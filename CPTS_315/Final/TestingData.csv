1,The Secret and Seven Habits of Highly Successful People,STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED THIS PART OF My ORDER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WOULD LOVE TO RECEIVE IT.
5,Phenomenal. A true gem and a life changer.,"At first glance the seemingly over the top reviews convinced me to purchase this book. After just finishing it a few moments ago, I must say that the reviews haven't given it justice. This is truly a life-changing experience, which allowed me to get back on track. Starting from an almost, if not entirely, narcissistic standpoint I am now humbled. A must read and a true hand book for living."
4,Unique among motivational books,"This book is unique among most of the self-improvement books published in the last century because ""7 habits"" focuses on what Covey calls ""The Character Ethic"" instead of what he calls ""The Personality Ethic"". The Personality Ethic states that success is a function of public image, attitude, and the process of human interaction. Covey believes that The Personality Ethic focuses on the superficial, rather than the underlying problem of character. The Character Ethic states that the foundation of success is made up of attributes like fairness, integrity, honesty, and patience. Components of The Personality Ethic naturally flow out of a person who is rooted in the principles of The Character Ethic.Instead of focusing on specific motivation strategies, Covey focuses on creating the mindset a person needs before they can be motivated. I can't reccommend this book enough."
1,Ugh,I did not enjoy this book at all. Your time would be better spent sharpening a saw...literally. Go buy a saw and learn how to sharpen it.
1,7 Habits of Highly Effective People,"I freely give glowing positive reviews when they are deserved, and you can find plenty of my positive reviews elsewhere, -but you won't find one here! I spend a lot of time traveling in my car and I remember this as a very long and boring day that I gave to listening to all these twisted-around, rehashed, ""original"" ideas. Come on! Get serious! Anyone who is capable of thinking can have results equal to, or greater than those discussed here. This CD was not expensive, but I feel this was a complete waste of my time, and will be of your too if you go ahead and buy it. You don't need this CD. -Try honestly thinking for yourself."
4,Begin with the end in mind.,I am half way reading this book now or must I say experiencing it. I can recommend it already to everbody.
2,Stupid Book!,Did not like this book. I feel it is poorly written and very hard to understand. It was required reading for a course I was taking in culinary school. Don't buy it if you don't have to.
1,An invaluable book,"My life was changed by this book. I find Covey succesfully integrates a bleeding obvious paradigm into a work orientated lifestyle scenario schedule overview bla bla bla. Amusing diagrams of circles around other circles with arrows pointing in. Then the same ones with different colours or the arrow reversed just in case you didnt understand the obvious points. If you like this book buy ""Should I drink poison or not"", ""Is Godzilla real"", ""How to make commone sense sound like a deep philosophy by using the word paradigm"" etc."
5,The Best Self-Educating Book,This Book Uncovers and Defines all the peculiarities of internal and external behavior. if you focus and take notes of the ideas mentioned you can make big changes in your life. I Highly Recommend this Book for anyone willing to enhance the quality of his life and has the courage to identify his weaknesses. Especially Useful to Middle East and 3rd world People.
1,please do not buy this book,"I am a positive person and have never once written a bad review. The ""author"" takes such basic subects and tries to build a paragraph with them. Stretching it out with repetiveness and a million and one unnecessary words. I tried so hard to read this book but simply could not. I became bored very quickly and almost felt anger that this man had taken MY hard earned money!!! 40 pages would have been ample to cover what this person has blown out over 300 plus pages. It is NOT a book....simply a pile of paper with a cover......sorry to be so negative."
5,STRATEGIES FOR EFFECTIVENESS,Stephen Covey outlines the best strategies for maximum effectiveness in this great book. The fact that this book has remained a best seller for over 15 years should tell you something about the merits of the informmation that it contains.Highly recommended book.
5,"A MUST READ, USEFUL, APPLICABLE,TIMELESS, TRASCENDENT","The wisdom of the seven habits, moves us to another platform of thinking and seing our human condition and our interations with other people.Its phylosophy is so pragmatical and valuable in every arena of life.Definitely, a classical and acclaimed book that will serve to build the highly competitive organizations of the 21th century.Ultimately it will contribute to the improvement society and development our soul."
5,great book!,Great book with lots of principles applicable to all areas of life. Highly recommend this book!
4,"Not an Audio ""Book""","This isn't the book word for word. Rather it is a lecture on the habits by the author. It was only 70 minutes long. Truly that's better for me, but wasn't what I expected."
5,Put it on your iPod,"I attended a Franklin Covey 7 Habits and changed my life... The next best thing was buying this audiobook and now I carry it on my iPod everywhere I go.Sometimes people complain when they miss a meal, when is the last time you gave your brain something to chew on? 5 stars all the way Steve..."
1,Don't bother...,"I'm giving one star only because there is no ""zero star"" designation. The ""information"" in this book is simple common sense couched in and disguised with flowery language to make it appear more than it is. Almost everyone should already know what's in this book before they read it. I suggest you save your money."
2,A number of years,"I read this book a number of years ago as part of a semester long class with it as the main teaching tool. From what I remember it provides good insights into time management, prioritizing tasks and breaking down a goal into bite size pieces so that a person isn't overwhelmed by the size of what needs to be done."
3,"Not bad, but ""over-intellectualized.""","The book is not bad. It's got some good advice, and if you live your life by the ""Seven Habits,"" then you're going to come out better than if you didn't live by them. But it's my opinion that Covey has made something quite simple quite complex. In other words, I believe that most of the ""Seven Habits"" are nothing profound: treat others like you would like to be treated), be goal-oriented, manage your time wisely, seek the wisdom and insight of others, be slow to speak and quick to listen - nothing new here. The problem is that Covey tends to intellectualize these concepts to the point that many readers may find it difficult to understand what he's talking about at times. And, those that do understand will become frustrated that he takes a whole lot of pages to say something that could have been dealt with in fairly short order."
3,Great material too bad it's one track and much shorter than the book,"Great and intelligent material, and because of that it requires repeatedly listening to it. Now, with one track only you need to FFW in order to go to a deeper section of the book.Also, this is a much shorter version of the book, so you must have the book too if you connect to this materials.Thank you Stephen for your contribution.I love it"
3,"Same Book, New Cover","I gave this one three-stars, because it turned out that this is the SAME book (but with a different cover) that was published a number of years ago. That fact was not clear to me when I read the description. Had I known that I would not have purchased it, as I have the prior book. It is a good book, but the lack of clarity as to WHICH edition it was, was really disappointing. There is NO new material in this book."
5,Excellent!!!,These are the best audio tapes I have ever read!!! They have changed my life indefinitely. I went from a hated poverty-stricken loser to a millionaire well admired and efficient man. I am constantly asked to speak at charity events and others. Buy these audio cassettes and read them. They WILL change your life too!!!!
3,Still reading through this,It is a very interesting book and I'm still working my way through it. I like the fact that its based on Victor Frankl's Mans Search for meaning which is must buy/borrow for anyone who hasn't read it.
5,One of the best books about Success,"This book will make history. Every page seems to have years of experience.A lot of material about effectiveness. Not only to business, but also family. BUY IT!"
3,Book I got...,"Reviewing this product, finally... Well this book wasn't for me, I ordered it for my aunt, I have no idea how good or bad this book was/is. I will, however, rate how it took to get here. For one book, it took a lil longer than I expected and I must say I have gotten clothes offline faster than that. And that's all I have to say."
5,Simply - the business!,Covey's 7 excellent habits is given an accessible treatment in this comprehensive CD package - ideal for those who have less time to read and appreciate the spoken word.
4,Very good book,This is very well written book. And with lot of practical things that can be used in daily life
3,Didn't keep my interest.,"He had some good things to say and some good points, but for the most part he wasn't telling me anything far from what I already knew. I got bored and never finished the book. Check it out from the library."
1,unset,When I received my books they were the mini ones. When I order these books they said nothing in the description about the size of the book.
1,Coveyisms Shoveyisms,"I can see where this book would appeal to people who like very orderly lives and who like to map everything out. I for one think that living my life by following a mission statement and 7 habits sounds like a drag. I don't think our reason for living is to be ""effective."" I'm not sure what it is for and I like it that way. It is good to not always react to things and take control of your life (Habit 1-Be proactive.) Keeping your priorities straight is smart advice also as is trying to be a better listener and understanding what others are really trying to say. There is nothing wrong with self-improvement, so I can see where this book could be handy. Yet, I must wonder, has Covey said anything in this book that hasn't been said before or that isn't blatantly obvious? Good for him that the was able to make millions upon millions requrgitating these ""habits,"" but I for one am glad I got my book at the library and didn't contribute to his wealth."
3,7 habits of highly effective people,....I was dissappointed that this was not an audio novel. It touches on key aspects without diving into deeper meaning.
3,Not that much new information in here,This book was okay but did not contain that much new information for me. I felt I was already doing much of what Covey suggests.
5,Exceptional Book,"Steven Covey struck gold with this book. He manages to help readers find their way to better effectiveness step by step in this groundbreaking book. The book is broken down by success habits. It's an exceptional book and I recommend it highly.Kristie Dean, author of Reformat Your Life (available on Amazon)"
3,A dissapointment,"To be honest, this book was a bit of dissapointment to me. As it is one of the most often recommended books in ""self improvement"" it somehow left me with a feeling of emptiness after reading it.Too high aims of the author and too much obvious outcome and advises to any having at least a bit of common sense, as well as sometimes too much religious approach while secretly trying to create something like a religion of authors own makes it one of the most overestimated books I've read in my life.And, by the way, the taglines of the book communicate the main ideas - the rest of the text is just beating around the bush"
2,7 Habits of Highly Effective People,"If you don't already realize everything that is said in this book, you probably can't read anyway. The book is years old. It spouts common sense, mundane platitudes, making it boring to read and highly ineffecitve.Amazing what some people succed in getting into print."
1,Seven Habits?,"Actually, I was (and I'm sure you will be too) surprised when I found upon reading Covey's self-help classic, that there are embedded within his highly helpful rhetorical flourishes actually EIGHT habits for ""highly effective people"". By applying Marshall Mcluhan's elegant and axiomatic adage ""the medium is the message"" I was able to discover the EIGHTH habit, which is to write self-help books and make a lot of money from them."
2,I gave the stars because it has helped a lot of people.,"I forced my way through this book. Never felt that 'a ha' moment. Even tried the CD's but, again, I was left cold and only temporarily inspired.However, I know folks that have changed their whole productivity patterns as a result of this book - so I know that it does good for some folks. I'm almost jealous of them for having such success!I like Tony Robbins better even though Covey considers him nothing more than a pep talk. Robbins is more my age and much more dynamic of a personality (entertaining). I'm productive in my own way and style; and having fun on this globe still rules over any acedemic or professional accomplishments that could be derived by trading my world for a seat in quadrant 2.But, who knows, I may find the inspiration to try this 7 Habit program one more time, just not yet. Again, that is only because I've SEEN it work for others in a BIG TIME way."
2,How to Turn Yourself Into A Robot,"I don't know why so many people think this book is so special. What I saw in it was just ideas that we all know explained in a way so complicated with confusing drawings and schematics that make the book very annoying. Even without this practice of easy concepts into rocket science, the ideas seem unnatural and contrary to the things that make us human. Maybe it is just what some people want so they can translate each activity into a formula or a matrix."
1,disappointed,"I mistakenly bought this book. I selected the book so quickly I didn't read the fine print, ""miniature"". The amazon price $5.95. Normal retail is $4.95. It is a 2in x 2in size book with 95 pages averaging a little over one sentence per page. You do the math. Buy the real book not this miniature version. Any Covey book is worth the investment...er, uhh maybe just not this one."
3,Hardcover=Miniature - Buy Paperback instead,Being of Yankee-descent I usually buy the cheaper of the two: paperback or hardcover. Mistake this time! The Hardcover is actually a miniature version of the book - paraphrased in a minimal amount of pages - suitable only for perhaps reading it on the sly in church. See dimensions in the fine print. Buy the 300+page paperback instead!
4,"Good but Heavy ""reading""",Covey's material is very good but his writing style has a high academic tone. An easy read it is not.
4,Is that Aretha?,"Great remake -- taking one of the best songs (from the best), spicing it up, and adding in a few extra treats -- for a great song..."
4,Good price and works,"It arrived on time, good price and works.I order other Supco 90380 from Amazon before. Supco sometimes make noise, White Rogers so far so good."
3,cornbread earl and me,"..Very timely even though this movie was from the 1970's, I would tell audiences of the 1970's genre movie to add this one to your collection..mint condition!!!"
4,Mixed Blessings,"Given the era and how so many films are degraded as blaxploitation, this was one that shouldn't carry that burden. The theme of ""us against the man"" was explored in a different way as no one picked up a gun and began blazing through the streets. A young Black Man that could have made it through ball but was killed along with the dream; this was told on film and in real life in different ways that were so similiar: Cochise in Cooley High, Ben Wilson in Chicago. The only diff being the man did it in this one and the Black residents that coulda and shoulda, wouldn't.Always a pleasure to see a young Fishburne work his lines and any 70's baller recognizes Jamaal Wilkes. An excellent movie, just don't be surprised if you feel the pain too."
1,Don't waste your time,Really have nothing good to say about this book. Only sorry that I wasted my time reading it.
5,mahjongg master 4,"The very first time i played this game was at my daughters home. I downloaded the game when i returned home. had the game for four years before i lost the computer. when i bought a new computer, i tried to download the same game from the website bit later found out it was not the same. then i remembered the orginal name of this game and found it on amazon.com. now i have the game itself and can download it any time and where ever i go. i am happy playing the game once again"
4,Nice lego toy,"This is a pretty good Lego toy. It was fairly tedious to put together - especially since there was one step skipped in the directions. After much confusion and more examination we finally figured out what was missing but it was a little annoying and took some time. My 4 yr old son loves it so far, except that the launch pad comes apart easily. It is pretty cool - Legos have come a long way."
1,Piece of Crap,"I live in a town in KY that IS this movie, only difference folks is that it is meth not pot these days! Yes life really does exist like this or worse. So, I do not recommend this movie, it is depressing, degenerative, boring, and presented the people accurately with an average IQ of a cucumber. ""Pitiful"" says it all about the movie and my town. Also, It was advertised incorrectly(ie:no detective story)."
5,Great Videos,"My son loves this video and all of the Lots To Learn Videos. Unlike most vidoes, the Lots to Learn vidoes keep his attention the whole time. Buster and Gatto are so cute and make him laugh, and the songs are very catchy. Best of all, they are educational so I don't feel guilty sitting him in front of the TV because I know he is going to learn. I highly recommend all of these videos."
1,Ugh!,"The package boasts ""classic cartoons""; this must refer to age only and not content or quality. The Warner Bros. cartoons have been stripped of their opening sequences with the credits and the ""Merrie Melodies"" theme music. Some of the other cartoons (Felix the Cat, Gabby, Toonerville Trolly) just aren't in the same league with those wonderful Warner Bros. Looneytoons. The picture restoration is fair; the sound restoration is tinny, and the ""enhancements"" to the sound effects are distracting. Save your money and buy something else."
5,This is the best animated movie I've ever seen,"I first saw Rainbow Brite when I had chicken pox at age five. When I woke up crying at 4 AM because it was so itchy, my mom would put in this video and it would all be ok. This has been my favorite TV show (closely followed by Care Bears) since then, and I love every part of this movie, from the creative plot to the awesome music to the clever characters. The animation, for its time, is wonderful, and as good as, if not better than, the animated cartoons we have today. I watch this movie when I'm sad, and when it ends I'm ready to conquer the world. I've recruited three new Rainbow Brite fans with this movie, and even the people that didn't like the movie had to admit it was good. I strongly recommend this movie for everyone; it won't scare little kids, and it's a MUCH better feel-good movie than a chick flick. If you watch this movie, I guarantee you'll love it."
3,not sexist,"It's missing the point dramatically to say that this film depicts girls as useless. There's a fairly typical boy/girl rivalry depicted, yes, but I don't believe anyone who watched the film from the start could reasonably think that girls are depicted as useless or powerless in it.I was able to figure out that the Krys character's opinion of girls was biased and unjustified (and, ultimately, proven wrong within the film) when I was eight. Today I'm a self-described feminist and I still think ""Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer"" presents a number of positive and powerful role models for young girls. I'd happily recommend it."
5,Brite eyes,"Rainbow Brite (Bettina Bush - ALSO the voice of Megan in My Little Pony ^_-), must save the world from the evil dark Princesse in this fantastic 80s film. The animation is really cute and brite, and is backed up nicely by a great score. I love this film and still remember my mum renting this out for me over and over again along with ""Labyrinth"" as a treat. HEY, that was 11/12 years ago! YET I still love it! Don't let Rainbow Brite die, they might have only made 13 forgotton episodes of the actual show, but buy this movie for your kids and the rainbow will never fade ;)"
4,Rainbow Brite question,was there 2 Rainbow Brite movies?? Whens the other one coming out if theres two??? Thanks.and my review is I love Rainbow Brite!!
3,It'll do,"But I preferred the box that came with VideoSecu. But, the cable is the part that is important, so it'll do."
5,Leaves surpasses expectations with its rich descriptions.,"110 specimens are the result of Alice Vitale's life-long avocation and work. The leaf drawings are exquisite and each herb is delightfully presented with a smattering of folklore, origins, medicinal uses, quotes and poems. Some very obscure herbs are covered in this compendium."
5,Later editions aren't the same,"What makes the first edition the best book of its kind is that it organizes plants by how they are used in landscaping (e.g., hedges and shrubs), then by color. So you determine what you want to do with the plants and how you want them to look, and it lists all of your choices with great color photos as well as height and width info.You'll have to buy a used copy to get the original organization model. Later editions list plants alphabetically, which is pretty much useless."
3,A Topical Richard Brooks Drama,"I have yet to see this film played on any Television cable channel. Brooks brings to the screen Robert Ruark's novel about the Mau Mau uprisings in the then British East Africa.Its a powerful story that is well acted by Rock Hudson, Sidney Poitier, Dana Wynter and Wendy Hiller.Here is a chance to see a terrific actor named Juano Hernandez( Young Man With a Horn, "" The Pawnbroker"") deliver the goods.Time has changed attitudes on subjects like these situations portrayed here. However, parts of this drama are salient even today although framed differently. One can take the geography out of this part of Africa and transpose these types of conflicts to other continents. Directed with care by Mr. Brooks."
1,Horrible!!! Printers can't line up with sticker!!! Tried 4 different printers!!!,DO NOT BUY!!!! I tried to print the images on the stickers with 4 different ink jet printers and it doesn't line up. I wasted 10 dollars on two packs of these and wasted them all!!! Buy a case or pre-made sticker.
2,Only for INKJET printers,"Just FYI: this tattoo paper only works in inkjet printers. Something I didn't realize until after order arrived! Grrr.. Two stars for cool idea, but not laser printer friendly."
1,Worthless,"This watch was terrible. It had all the features I wanted and none of the reliability. The watch periodically turns off, resetting the time and all the alarms. Comes back on when all four buttons are pressed, so the battery can't need replacing. If that weren't bad enough, the glue holding the band together came undone."
4,Quiet hours over the board,"A nice study on how to improve one's chess game. It seems one of the best ways to get better at chess is to learn how to learn to play chess -- its pedagogy. Although the chapters in this book are not progressive, the variety of chapters allows the learner to pick and choose the study. My ELO is only 1900, so I would not recommend this book to beginners."
2,Not what I expected,"Many professional chess book reviewers claim this is for the advanced player (FIDE rating of 2000+). ([...]) It ""goes without saying"" that anything by Dvoretsky is for the serious player who wants to put in the time and has an extensive chess background.Most of the articles are very good, however the exercises are way to easy to be useful (if you read the articles). My disappointment was mainly that this book is a collection of seemingly random and unconnected articles/lectures, few of them had anything to do with actual ""chess training."" The ones that did were very creative and different than what most Western players are familiar/comfortable with...I suppose if you are at that the level where one idea will make that much of a difference you might get something out of this book... however, if you need a system of thought or some teaching on a process then look elsewhere."
4,Good Gaming Book,If your into gaming this is a book for you. It delivers what it promises in providing the key essential to gaming. I recommend it.
5,Game Development praise,"Jeannie Novak's book Game Development Essentials is an excellent text covering the scope of today's gaming environment. Everything from story development, marketing, character development and audience demographics is covered in this text. She uses highly appropriate first person narratives from industry professionals and has excellent study guide questions at the conclusion of each chapter. The CD included also has great game demos and trials as well as excellent links to web sites that add enrichment to the reading. I look forward to her other upcoming titles."
5,Great Service,"It is the book i needed for school, well actually one edition older than i needed but it had all the same info. The seller was extremely quick in shipping the product and it arrived promptly ."
2,Bad use of airborne troops,Very much the most excellent good guys against the very bad bad guys. Both use troops up badly.
1,"Oh, Brother!","The great Lupe Velez deserves a good biography, but this ain't it. To paraphrase the late Mrs. Parker, ""this is not a book to be tossed aside lightly. It is to be thrown with great force."""
5,MiRiCAL22003,"I was told that I had PCOS because my cycle was simply ""irregular"" & I was on a car accident that almost took my life & my cycles changed even more, didn't have a menstrual cycle for years! I got this book which names ALL my symptoms which then made me go get PROPER testing & was officially diagnosis ed with PCOS! THiS BOOK WAS GREAT & FULL OF HELPFUL INFORMATION!"
4,PCOS - ????,I had never heard of PCOS before my OB/GYN gave me my diagnosis that I had this syndrome. I was very anxious to find out all that I could and still go back to this book when I have questions. More women should ask their doctor about this syndrome especially if you are watching your diet and exercising but not losing weight.
3,The evolution of a filmaker.,"Sorry I cheated. I was watching Dick Cavett interviewing Woody Allen in 1971 0n TCM, & got sucked in again watching Bananas. Hadn't seen it in years. Not his best or nearly so, but it was only his 2nd & he was still perfecting his craft. Fielding Mellish is dating Nancy, a political activist. She dumps him presumably for his insincerity. To get her back (& in the sack) he becomes a freedon fighter in a small tropical dictatorship. Funny, absurd & ultmately uneven. If it is your bag, this needs to be in your Allen archives as the beginning of a brillant screenwriter/director. The bits with Howard Cosell are stiil laugh out loud funny after multiple viewings."
1,"Slipped, lacks appeal","This is a good movie for people who don't like to think too much. While better than watching (un)reality TV or monster truck rallies, as far as I'm concerned this isn't a film for fans of Woody Allen, it's just a series of really thin gags which make me want to. Woody's ""Sleeper"" is a more sophisticated version of ""Bananas"" (and it was better shot) and of the two, get the former. This is one of those ""earlier, funny ones"" referenced in the usually underrated ""Stardust Memories"". Like ""Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Sex"", it isn't a high point of his career."
5,I can't believe I found this:),"I saw this movie twice back in 82, and still remember most of the words to the songs. ""Leaping, leaping leaping for lunch,dressed like a salad,how does it feel?"". Wasn't her blowup pool sand box bed the best! I can't believe I found a way to get a copy of it. It's a MUST Have movie for 80's culture and musical buffs."
1,Failed attempt at comedy,"Made in America fails to bring in the laughs, and worse, it presents a great opportunity to deal with race issues, yet never deals with it beyond ""He's white? He can't be your father!""This film begins with a promising premise. What if a black girl found out her father, a sperm donor, was actually white? But instead of creating a fascinating mix of social commentary on race and brilliant comedy, it gives us slapstick. And unfunny slapstick at that. I laughed... once.This film's one saving grace is Whoopie. She adds some energy to most of her scenes. But even she seems unexcited to be in this movie. It's one of her least funny roles. Made in America also gives a young Will Smith a role, and it's clear from the start that it wasn't until after this film that he matured as an actor.This movie is only for really, really big Whoopie fans."
4,History is only as boring as your teacher,"The book is not boring on any account. It is not an easy subject, but the author does explain the different forces behind the failure of 1917 and the success of 1918. The book is not a typical historical resource. Johnson uses forshadowing and vivid description to give it a novel quality. If you want to know more about the politics behind the stalemate and the final victory in World War I, then I would highly recommend this book."
5,Track listing,"01: put a little love in your heart 3:5002: ""family love"" mix sample :3003: ""pure melissa"" women's mix sample :3004: ""just a little"" men's mix sample :30"
4,Helpful and reliable,"What can you say about a hornbook? I'm trying to review the ones I use for class as fast as I finish using them, but except for famous ones like Prosser and Keeton, there's not much to do other than point out whether I found them helpful and reliable.This one was both. As an evening law student with delusions of eternal youth, I just completed two semesters of property law during summer session, and I surely found Hovenkamp's discussions useful. (In general I prefer hornbooks to casebooks anyway.) The text includes lots of sample problems as well; you may especially appreciate this feature when you discuss estates, future interests, and the Rule Against Perpetuities.I didn't notice anything that clearly set it apart from other property-law hornbooks, but we don't, after all, buy these things for the bells and whistles. It's a solid book that covers a standard subject in pretty much the standard order. Recommended to law students."
5,duet of the decade,"This duet CD embodies the most simpatico expression of two jazz musicians in the last decade, bringing to mind the duets of Duke Elllington and John Coltrane, and Bill Evans and Jim Hall. From the Michael Wolff original Polly, to Alex Fosters's own Pool of Dreams, to the Mingus and Monk tunes, these two masters, Wolff of the piano and Foster of the saxophone, create a soulful, impressionist flight of fancy that transforms notes and rhythms into the magic of textures and colors. This CD is a must for any CD collection, and for anyone who only wants to own one CD, this is the one."
2,Can't listen 'N learn while driving ...,"I bought these CDs hoping to listen and learn while driving. Unfortunately, the CDs require that you listen, read the book, and follow along, so it's not possible to just listen and learn; you need to refer to the book while listening. The sound level of the dialogues is much lower than the voice of the person leading the lessons, so you have to adjust the volume every time he talks. This is distracting and annoying. A disppointment, on the whole."
5,love this story,"this book is great for therapists who work with young children! my daughter also brought this to preschool when she was 3 yo and her entire class enjoyed it. good for improving labeling, sequencing, identifying, and cause and effect skills. the ending is especially fun."
2,disappointing quality,"I happen to really like this film. It's one that I can watch repeatedly and always enjoy. But the DVD version has such poor video quality that I returned it and have kept the VHS. The sceen in the graveyard, in particular, is not what I'd expect if a decent master has been used for the transfer. Check it out, but keep your receipt!"
4,The Great Train Robbery,"Connery and Sutherland provided an exciting re-enactment of the famous robbery. Although the ending was different, the entire movie was filled with suspense ans excitement. Well worth watching."
2,"Great movie, miserable quality","This is an excellent movie - well acted, good plot and character development... but truly miserable video quality. It appears to have been ""mastered"" from the VHS issue... and not very well at that. Truly a shame."
2,great movie but DVD has truly dismal video quality,"Everything about this DVD movie of Michael Crichton's The Great Train Robbery is marvelous except for the truly abysmal, grainy low resolution quality of the video itself. I don't know what the source of the problem is, but the result is one of the worst DVD's I've ever viewed when it comes to the actual video quality of the product. Virtually every scene is grainy and out of focus. It's a shame such great sets, great acting, great costumes, and great plot are all marred by the genuinely bad video quality. In sum, if you value video quality, do not buy this DVD. And, just to be clear, I'm not judging this DVD against a blu-ray. I have seen VHS tapes with as good and even better video quality than this DVD has. Someone should make a new transfer/copy/version of this, or even better, make a good quality blu-ray. I wish I had read the reviews more carefully as I probably would not have purchased this had I known how bad the video really is."
1,Elixir crapweb.,"If anyone is thinking about buying these, DON'T. Do not waste your money on these strings. If you like to precisely control what you're playing (especially if you play Metal), do not get these strings. The coating is too slippery and feel uncomfortable. And most importantly!! The tone is NOT bright and the sustain is horrible. They can't hold a chord without fading quickly especially if you bend a lot. If you want amazing, well manufactured, loud and controllable strings I suggest checking out GHS Boomers. With GHS you will not be disappointed, unlike Elixir. ( I personally use GHS Boomers TnT [thin top heavy bottom])"
4,Good as usual,"Strings work like good strings should. I've been a fan of these for years, both when I played classical and then when I switched to acoustic steel string guitars. They usually take a little longer to break in but they keep a brighter tone for much longer than Ernie Balls, Markeleys, and other strings I've used."
4,Charming little film,"For those unfamiliar with GÃ©rard Depardieu, GREEN CARD is a charming introduction. Good performances from both Depardieu and Andie MacDowell, and Bebe Neuwirth is delightful in a supporting role. When things get ""unfair"", the reminders that the central marriage of convenience is illegal are refreshing.The DVD is presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen with both English and French Dolby 5.1 audio tracks. No extras, but even so an excellent bargain."
4,One of my all-time favorites!,"Classic boy-meets-girl romantic comedy, but the story woven around this bare outline is new and different and totally delightful. The non-standard happy/sad ending only adds to its charm.Except for a couple of instances where a seriously ""four-letter"" word is used (to the embarrassment of the characters in the story), this is a movie that the whole family would be comfortable viewing together.I'm glad I own the tape!"
3,Prancer,"I liked the little girls determination and final result. I really enjoy Sam Elliott's work, but I didn't like Sam Elliott playing a mean spirited father."
5,Prancer - A must for your Christmas Movie Collection,"At our house - we are Christmas movie fans, and this one is right near the top of our list with White Christmas, Its a Wonderful Life, and One Magic Christmas. Delightful, enjoyable and a heartwarming story of a girl who will NOT let go of her zeal for Christmas and all things attached to it.Great for all ages.And Sam Elliott still looks good even when scruffy in this movie."
1,I never actually revceived my order,"I placed my order for this DVD on December 13th ... I was told that it would ship on the 15th but may not arrive until January 5th. Needless to say, this gift did not arrive in time for the holidays. It is now January 19th and I have seen no sign of my order. I have contacted the seller twice through email and never heard back. On the bright side, at least my order was only $9! I do not plan to ever order from this seller again."
4,Fun Christmas movie.,"This is a good Christmas movie...not on par with It's a Wonderful Life, Miracle on 34th Street, or The Christmas Story (which I actually didn't care for, but I know lots of people love it), but it's a good story. I like having Christmas movies on DVD, so I can pop one in when I'm doing my Christmas baking."
5,Excellent,I love this book. The pictures are excellent and the recipes are simple and easy to follow.The book arrived by the promised delivery date and in excellent condition.Thank you
5,The music I have been finding for 2 years,I am korean. I heard Cafe Reggio when I was in New York for my studying. Sometimes I heard it from WQ CD 101.9 that is smoohtjazz station in New York. But at that time I did not know the musitian and title. It took about a week to find out this music and musitian. I happened to find smoothjazz guitar album and wrote down names of the players. I searched all of them name by name in this amazon address. Finally I fount this. This passion shows the degree I like this music. Easy melody and very wonderful sound
4,My Niece Loves It!,"This was a gift for my niece, Erika. She loves it, and from what I know it works great. I gave it four out of five stars, because, in my mind, it has a cheap look to it and looks like it could fall apart without too much effort. That said, Erika made a padded case for its protection and thinks it's fab. It seems to work well, tunes well, and is loud enough as a metronome to hear over her violin. So - I definitely recommend this, but just use it carefully."
2,Streisand's nose and voice go on forever...,"Far too much singing and profile shots of the schnozz from hell. I much preferred the South Park episode of MECHA-STREISAND that accurately portrays the actress as a 50-foot tall robot that eats people, shoots missiles from her nose, and yearns to take over the world. The scenery and costumes are good in Yentl, and the plot is fairly engaging (though it follows the usual cliches of cross-dressing ala Shakespeare, Bosom Buddies, Tootsie, etc.). If you took out the singing, the movie would be much better... and about 20 minutes long. It's worth seeing, I guess, as long as your remote mute button works. I'm buying a copy for a friend as a joke."
3,Mono!,"Not to rain on your parade, but the reason it is finally being released and for such a bargain price, is because the film is unaltered from its original form and the soundtrack is therefore in mono. Yentl was released on DVD in Europe (region code 2) two years ago, with the same disappointing mono soundtrack and no extra's. Why Miss Streisand hasn't bothered to finalize her pet project and make sure it was released with a new digitalized 5.1 surround soundtrack is beyond me. We all know the film and score deserve it. Nevertheless it will finally be available in the States for home entertainment! Enjoy!"
5,Facsinating and believable.,I enjoyed Yentl very much. It is an eye opener onto the private lives of strict judiasm. It should be required by all to watch.
4,"Lovely Cinematography, Beautiful Music, Great Story!",I really think that this is such a great movie and I can't believe that I am just now watching it. It will not be the last time for me.....I hope to watch it many more times.
5,"A joy to read. Intelligent, fast paced. A must read!!!",I thouroughly enjoyed this book. It's a thrill ride like few I've read A real page turner. Morrell's style shines in this one. I recommend it to anyone who loves thrill rides (and has a strong stomach) It makes you think and put things together. It also shocks you over and over again.
1,disappointing,I have enjoyed so many of Morrell's books but was let down by this one. The lack of focus was almost unbearable. I finished the book feeling very unsatisfied.
3,This is not David Morrell's greatest work to date.,"David Morrell deviates from his normal style of writing in Double Image. The book begins as a promising piece with gripping imagery and text, but quickly deteriorates into a book more befitting Tami Hoag. Morrell has too much going on at once and lacks cohesion. I look forward to his next work. Allow me to add that David Morrell is one of the best in his genre, and this minor setback will not restrain his creative edge."
2,WERE IS THE REAL DAVID MORRELL???????,"""FIRST BLOOD"" ""BLOOD OATH"" ""THE BROTHERHOOD OF THE ROSE"" ""THE FRATERNITY OF THE STONE"" ""THE LEAGUE OF NIGHT AND FOG"" ""THE FIFTH PROFESSION"" ""THE COVENANT OF THE FLAME"" THESES ARE THE BEST FICTION BOOKS EVER WRITTEN!!!!!!!!! DAVID WE WANT MORE BOOKS LIKE THESES, NOT ""DOUBLE IMAGE"" LOOK AT THE REVIEWS OF THOSES BOOKS, ALL 5's COMPARE THAT WITH ""DOUBLE IMAGE"" THAT SHOULD SAY SOMETHING.YOU ARE THE BEST FICTION WRITER OF TODAY HOPE THE NEXT BOOK WILL MEASURE UP!!!!!"
2,Melted on first use,"Used this spatula to make scrambled eggs. Fit my skillet wonderfully, worked really well folding the eggs in the pan. However when I was washing it i found that it had melted along the edge of the large end. Very disappointed by that."
5,"Fascinating, entertaning, insightful, powerful , wonderful..","Reviewer: Michael Adams, President, Fairleigh Dickinson University, New Jersey....The concepts of Creative Business Idea's [CBI's], organizational DNA and wars rooms are capturing. Bob Schmetterer skillfully built his case with strong examples and reinforced key ideas with ""Before You Leap"" summaries. I thought the ""voice"" quite masterful - quite personal and capturing. Throughout Bob's career, and across Euro RSCG units, breathtaking CBI's have been created, but there is no hint of arrogance. It comes across as simply, "" this is the way we do business - so should you."""
5,Excellent beginers overview of millinery techniques,"Having been a student of Ms. Albrizio's, I highly recomend this book to anyone interested in the millinery industry."
4,Fine for oversized but could be better,"I only use french press pots, so my review doesn't address the virtues of a french press in general. (Coffee in the french press is the best!)This one is good because it is oversized, which is useful if there are even 2 coffee drinkers. What I love about this is that it is thermal. However I've had other thermal press pots that were more insulated.The annoying thing about this is the pour. It drips and leaks if you pour at a regular speed because the spout is very narrow. you have to control your pour to a trickle to keep it from spilling on the counter.Other than that, it's fine."
3,Bodum vs. Frieling,"I have owned the Bodum, Columbia 51 ounce French press for 5 years now. It is beautiful. However, I am finally disposing of it, and trading UP to the Frieling. The main reason; the rubber-edged gasket plunger of all the Bodum designs wears out, and you get coffee grounds in your pour!The Frieling and Thermos/Nisan French presses have all-steel plunger-edges that will not wear out as easily (although the steel mesh does need to be maintained). These non-rubber designs simply work better. Plus, the Frieling design is also quite attractive and has a better."
1,customer service,Thermos is fine. Customer service lacking. Received wrong size. Ordered17 oz was sent 35 oz. E-mailed about problem - no response. Still waiting.........
5,That's the stuff!,"Prince created his best album ever in Sign o' the Times, blending rock, pop, funk, and saucy soul balladry seamlessly to give his listeners both a demonstration of his undeniable musical genius, as well as a history lesson as to where R&B has come from and what it has become. Melodically and lyrically, his best work. Highlights: Ballad of Dorothy Parker, If I Was Your Girlfriend, I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man."
4,Prince's best during the late 80's!,"I think this is some of Prince's best work. None of it has the extreme controversy of earlier albums like ""Controversy"" or ""Dirty Mind"", yet he comes close with ""If I Was Your Girlfriend"" (remember the radio stations editing out the ending?), ""It"", and ""Hot Thing"". This CD is second only to ""1999"", but not by much. It packages several messages contained within danceable tunes, the title track being the main one. My favorite, for fun, is ""Housequake"" - for it's funky beat & memorable phrase, telling us to ""shut up, already!"""
5,Great machine for small families,I can't compare this to any other bread machine because it is the first and only one I have owned so I will just give you my impressions on this specific unit. It works very well and I am very satisfied with it. The loaves are small enough that you usually eat them before they turn stale. It is also great for making pizza and cookie dough. The initial cost compared to other machines is high but so far it has operated flawlessly.
1,too small and not safe,"The bucket is too small.Followed a recipe for basic bread from their book, dough spilled over the edge and made a mess inside machine, a lot of smoke also.I was lucky to be at home and switched it off.Customer support told me that I probably put too much flour (did not measure it right).I am not confident it would not happen in future again, so I returned it to Amazon for refund."
2,"Sadly, it is being returned","I like to make my own bread. But I find that I don't make it as often as I like because it is very time consuming. So, I decided to buy a bread machine.Unfortunately, despite the glowing reviews and my own sister's recommendation, this product did not live up to my expectations. Every loaf I made did not rise as much as I would like and the bottom crust always turned out tough and almost burned.Faced with the decision to have inferior bread on a more frequent basis, or much better bread on an irregular basis, I decided to return this and go back to making bread by hand."
4,Works great after some experiments,"Had problems with first 3 breads made using this machine.1) not rised enough, fixed by doubling the amount of yeast as specified in the recipe came with the flour.2) uneven rise, sometimes large hole in the bread, fixed by changing to a better yeast.3) too hard, fixed by using light/soft setting.After these fixes, every bread made is excellent, perfect rise and soft.The amount of ingredient is not as critical as emphasized in the manual.As mentioned, amount and quality of the yeast is important. More is better than less.This recipe always works for me: 1 cup water, 2 cups of flours (any kind), 2 TBsp of dry milk , 1 TBsp of sugar (2 is OK), 1 TBsp of butter, 1 Teasp of salt, 2/3 TBsp of yeast."
3,a very funny movie,Very much unknown but really a title every collector of good American comedies should own. John Ritter at his very best...
1,Root Cause?? More Like Finding a Scapegoat!!,"Accidents happen because of an amalgamation of errors, not simply because of one person's ""human error"". Design faults, management pressures, poor training, long shifts, poor device interfaces, insufficent safety guards, poor maintenance, and many other issues come together to afford an accident that would not have caused that accident alone. Finding root cause enables blame to be placed and make the rest of the system feel ""safe"" while latent problems still linger. Safety is created by fostering a culture that sees risks for what they are and works to minimize those risks (better training, better safety guards, lessening worker fatigue) and NOT by placing blame on one ""root cause""."
1,Very disappointing,"I thought this book was terrible - very disappointing. You say it's difficult to tell a story through the eyes of children - maybe that's why I could never figure out which generation they were talking about. The endless description of everything at the beginning of the book made me keep looking for the story and, once I found it, was disappointed in what I found. The only reason I read this book to the end was that my bookclub was studying Charming Billy for the next meeting and I wanted to read another of her books first. I hope Charming Billy is better than this one."
1,Surprise,I think that this is a serie B .............. no ZI regret to buy it.Anne Parillaud as vampire is not credible.red eyes ok funny but the sound ........... movie to forget
2,"good movie, bad dvd","First off, let me say that this a great B movie -- good acting, good direction, and a good script that never takes itself too seriously.Unfortunately, like so many early Warner Bros. DVD releases this disk fails to deliver on the potential of the movie. It offers full screen format instead of anamorphic widescreen or the letterboxing available on the laserdisc release. The production notes are insignificant. The movie begs for a commentary track. Even a spotter's guide to the cameos or appearences of Landis' hallmarks ('See You Next Wednesday' and 'The Girl from Ipanema') in the film would have been nice.Hopefully WB will realize that this movie didn't sell on DVD because they packaged it poorly, not because people don't want to own it. That might mean an eventual rerelease in widescreen."
3,Pretty ... but not very functional.,"These are nice to look at, but the creamer lid is constantly falling into the container, and the sugar spoon is weirdly shaped."
2,Lids are a problem,"The lids are a little fiddly to open and close since they have no handles, are completely flat, and sit flush with the lip of the container. That's particularly a problem on a sugar bowl, which gets opened and closed every time someone takes some sugar out. I can see it would just be a matter of time until one of my guests tips over the bowl trying to get it open or closed. It's not that you can't open the lid--you can--but why would you want to give your guests a test of manual dexterity after a relaxing dinner? I love the look of the clean, sleek, minimalist design (I have the matching coffee press and it's great), but this is a case of aesthetics compromising functionality. I won't be using these."
3,"Very nice, but not insulated/double walled","If you read the description on bodum.com, you'll expect that these are double walled, to keep the creme cold. However, I just received them, and it was apparent that they are both single walled construction. I even poured cold water into the creamer, and it immediately had condensation on the outside surface up to the line which the water reached.As per the other reviewers, the lid on the sugar bowl looks like it will prove difficult to consistently put on, so I'd recommend expecting you will need to leave it off while serving coffee, and only put it on between uses. The lids on my set fit snugly, and the set has a bright polish to match the Bodum Columbia coffee presses."
4,Nice But Not Brushed Silver,"This stainless steel sugar and creamer set looks nice and modern and it's a good price for two items. But I was dissapointed that it was not brushed stainless steel since the picture makes it look like it is. It acutally has a shiny mirror finish. If that's what you are looking for, then this is a good quality item."
2,They are nice but a lot smaller than I anticipated,"They are nice but a lot smaller than I anticipated. This is a serving set for when some one comes over for tea/coffee, not to keep on your kitchen counter for daily use - which is why I bought it. It is really cool looking though."
5,Best of the series--as long as it's not the last!,"This book was definitely the best of the Cheney DuVall, M.D. series. Having never been near a volcano, I can't be certain, but it seems that the descriptions were completely accurate and very vivid. There were many more adventures and disasters in this book that the previous, and there was more talk about a deep relationship with the Lord. The only problem with the book was the ending. There was much left unsaid, unfinished, and unresolved. Another book is definitely needed."
1,A very disappointing end to the series,"This book is the worst in the series. Cheney and Shiloh are out of character and their relationship is not resolved. This book is also completely predictable; the back of the book explains the entire ""plot"". It appears the series is over and yet the only answers the reader receives is about Shiloh's past."
5,My New Favorite CD,"Cecilia is astoudingly beautiful in this CD. Her voice is so enchanting and perfect that it is easy to forget sometimes that the sound is coming from a human being. Even if you don't usually like opera singers, I recommend this CD as an introduction to music that will transport you and even perhaps make you swoon."
3,Pretty good for the money,"I would suggest that anyone who spends time on the water learn to use a chart and the proper instruments, beyond the GPS. GPS is a valuable tool but batteries die, and electronics don't mix well with water. Weems and Plath instruments all seem to be very good.This was the least expensive set of dividers I could find. I was surprised to find that the knob on top did not allow you to tighten the dividers as is normal with this device. Also one of the tips is sharper than the other. Only time will tell if the dividers will loosen and become useless, but for now they work very well. I would recommend these over any shorter dividers, this is the smallest that I would use."
4,update on the cover story,"Leonard Knight of Niland, CA (Cover Picture) has been busy since this publication. He originally came to this remote place as a result of a failed attempt to cross the desert in a balloon. His fans and supporters recently attempted to build a new balloon for him but that went bust and he remains in the area.He's very old and now (2012) receiving care at an undisclosed facility. His friends are trying to preserve his massive Salvation Mountain project.He has been something of a hermit, working alone on this project for decades. But don't think of him as anti-social. Most days, one or two people found their way to him and were entranced by his Mountain and his warm personality. He now has thousands of friends, in a more real sense than most on Facebook."
2,Was this the best they could do?,"A poor production, both sight and sound. Rumpole, and the people who love the series, deserve better."
5,Best Radiology book for the non radiologist,"Best Radiology book for the non radiologist. Thick pages for the high quality pictures. Concise explanations. Mostly xray content. Where some Radiology books almost skip xrays because to radiologists, xrays are simple. Those other radiology books have mostly CT and MRI info."
4,Great Toy!,"Most Lego creations break at some point or another. With this one, when it comes apart, you don't have to start at the beginning to re-build it - you can usually just snap a piece back together. When put together, this set has actual working missile launchers. It also has a bomb launcher and two hidden guns. It comes with Boba Fett, two other bounty hunters, a Bespin guard, and Han Solo in Carbontine. The cockpit swivels when you rotate the ship body. That's cooler than having to twist a dial or something like I have to do on my X-Wing Fighter Lego set."
2,The bottom front keeps falling apart,"I gave my 6-year old this for Christmas. It was what he wanted. He had no problem building it on his own for the most part, except that the bottom front kept falling apart. I had to help him reattaching it again and again, but the pieces are just not meant to stay together. Now is all finished except that it is missing the front bottom. I don't think it's well designed."
1,falls apart,My son is usually very good at assembling Legos and was having great difficulty with this one. I tried to help him out and every time I added a new piece another section came apart. I honestly can't comprehend how it would stay together unless an adhesive is used. This is the most poorly designed lego toy I have ever encountered. Especially disappointing for such an expensive toy.
5,The Rutles:Long live the kings of parody!,"Although I grew up as a child of the 60's, I never could quite get my mind rapped round the appeal of the Beatles.I could,however, appreciate a good ribbing.Well, this is the best bloody ribbing I have ever seen out of Hollywood - this film is the best bit of satire this side of the Discworld novels! While not so well known (indeed, I've only known one other person who has heard of it) as Spinal Tap, The Rutles succeeds brilliantly at the over-the-top humour which eluded the other film.This is THE best example of intelligent-satire-disguised-as-farce that has come along since ""Carry On Cleo."" If I could choose one film to represent the comedy genre, this would be it.I can but hope that the studio will one day see fit to re-release this comedic masterpiece on video, so a new generation will be able to experience this gem."
5,A bad idea whose time has come!,"Easily a match for (and predating by about six years) the Spinal Tap movie, this video is a must-have for fans of the Beatles (if they have a sense of humor) and the Python boys alike. The jokes are plentiful, but may not produce rollicking laughter until the third viewing or so--which is okay, because like the Monty Python films, this movie does not get old! The Rutles are, quite simply, a bad idea whose time has come! Hilariously funny."
5,One of the funniest movies ever made,"OK, so it helps to know The Beatles inside and out to totally get this movie. Even if you don't, it's still a riot. But if you do know The Beatles, this is perfect. It's the funniest movie I've ever seen.Idle and Innes hit a grand slam here. Every scene is hilarious, nearly every line is a complete crack-up. The Beatles needed to be spoofed and they gave their blessing for this project. My guess is they even found it funny (though I doubt John liked seeing Nasty's wife portrayed as a Nazi).The capper is the music. Some of the songs are just brilliant rip-offs, combining two or three elements of three Beatles songs. Example, ""Hold My Hand"" combines ""I Want to Hold Your Hand,"" the ""Eight Days a Week"" intro, and ""She Loves You."" Just priceless.If you like The Beatles, you'll really like ""The Rutles."" If you like great comedy, you'll love this. It's a can't-miss classic!"
5,"Hilarious, smart, and affectionate","No fan of either The Beatles or Monty Python can afford to miss this wonderful parody. It manages to be consistently hilarious while remaining clear in its affection for The Beatles themselves. How can you not love a show with lines like, ""It was here they found themselves--far from home, and far from talented""? Brilliant and sadly overlooked by many comedy fans who would love it as much as I do."
5,The Prefab Four,"This was a fantastic parody. The first real mockumentary, in fact. The brainchild of Monty Python's Eric Idle, The Rutles is a film that follows around the ""Prefab Four"" (the Rutles) as the band experiances the trials and tribulations of fame, success, and love.Originally made for SNL, it features cameos from such alumnus as Dan Akroyd, Gilda Radner, John Belushi, and Bill Murray, just to name a few. Even George Harrison makes an appearance as an older reporter in the movie.Eric Idle's reporter character is hilarious, and Neil Inne's Nasty character is perfectly John Lennon, dead on.The DVD has some great features as well, including a ""songs only"" option (something the Beatles Anthology should have taken advantage of) and Eric Idle's memoires. The memoires offer a great insight into the movie and make for some interesting reading.If you liked ""This is Spinal Tap"" and other musical mockumentaries, see the one that started it all and witness, firsthand, Rutlemania."
1,Don't Buy It!!,"Amen to the first review! I wish this had been advertised with the brand name so we could have read reviews before we bought it. Looks great, but smokes no matter what you do. Terrible waste of money."
4,One Great Movie,"One of the better spoofs of the 90's, this movie is great! Its great post-gulf war timing only adds to the humor, and it will keep you rolling the whole time."
3,A tad...,This book was. Tad slow and hard to get into. I love connie mason books but this was one wasnt there for me
2,it's no Gods and Generals,"I was hopping that this fictional account of the civil war will have the same riveting battle scenes and in-depth account of the human struggle as the war escalated, but it was quite disappointing. Starbuck and all the other characters are two-dimensional. Also the future of how each characters turn out by the end of the novel is quite predictable. Therefore, I know I wouldn't be reading the second book."
4,"In Response to ""A Music Fan""","The song that plays during the credits is called ""Song To The Siren"" by Robert Plant. It is on his CD titled ""Dreamland"". Get it, you will be glad you did! I gave this soundtrack 4 stars because they omitted two great songs that were in the movie: Meet Me in the Morning by Bob Dylan, and Sweet Thing by Van Morrison. What were they thinking?"
4,Product review,This is a good product its very easy to install and the instructions are very easy to follow I recommend this product if you want to make space on your handlebars
5,Great Gadget!,"Such a cool little gadget! I bought this to mount a Sigma bike computer/heart rate monitor on. The computer is wireless and has to be within a certain proximity range to both the transmitter on the front fork and the heart rate monitor belt that you wear around your chest in order to get accurate readings. After a couple of trial locations, I found it worked best if I mounted it at a right angle to the handlebar stem, angled to the left side and somewhat parallel, but lower than the left side handlebar on my bike. At this location, the readings are very accurate and it's very easy to see and use the computer. The Topeak Bar Extender is very easy to install, is well-built and is very sturdy once installed and it looks great too. The design offers excellent flexibility for mounting just about anywhere at various angles and lengths. Highly recommended!!!"
3,Disaster at Baru,"The book was in good condition. There was no cover oin the book, and I do not remember that being noted in the description. I might not have bought it without the cover on it. I am hoping that I can buy one with the actual, original cover. Otherwise, I received the book quickly. No problems there"
4,Awesome!,"This movie had the wow factor as far as I'm concerned. I laughed, cried and got angry at my television screen. I am being honest and saying that I had difficulty reading the subtitles as an English-only speaker but I adjusted quickly and it was well worth it. The story and plot were something so different from what I would normally watch yet I enjoyed it because it kept me involved and watching. Very great film."
3,cute design but not perfect,"This seat looks great in our kids' bath, but on our toilet the seat does not stay up, it falls back down. This is a nuisance for the guys.Also, some of the design is chipping off after a year of normal use."
1,a bad book,"This is a poorly written, badly organized, and inaccurate book. It commits, repeatedly, the mortal sin of any text book by reffering to terms and concepts before they are introduced; its use of language is, well, 'non standard'; and there are plenty of typos. All in all a waste of money!"
5,coneheads,i purchased this movie for my son.he loves this movie.and thank you so much for selling it.and having it available to buy.it is in good shape.no problems at all.and i will order from you when i can from time to time.thank you teddy
4,Coneheads -DVD,"The Conedheads - DVD, what can I say a good old fashioned Dan Aykroyd comedy movie. Enjoyed by all in the family"
5,Conehead VHS,Very happy to find this tape for a sort of reasonable price as these go. Too bad they have discontinued this movie
1,could not play.,Was a great price but was coded in europe so could not see in theater room or TVs. Could only see on small computer screen. Very disappointing.
3,Misleading title and cover,"I did know about this movie before seeing the title and cover actually from the SciFi channel. So I was not misled, myself, by the title and cover when I saw them. However, I do agree that volcanoes are a marginal even irelevant) part of this and it is definitely not a disaster film. Kind of a strange supernatural themed weak love story, perhaps. Not a terrible movie, but not really good either. At least, not something I liked. I didn't feel I could give it a '2' just because it was not to my liking because it wasn't flat out bad. So I've given it a '3' since I think the atmosphere and somewhat clever idea behind it is better than a '2' (ignoring the general irrelevance of the volcano bits)."
3,WHEW,"I was not expecting this to be so spicey and hot. I wish they could find a way to label these so people with digestive problems would have a way of knowing before we order. I am rather new to Amazon.com, so maybe I missed something. If you like hot and spicey with a good flavor, you will like this."

1,"After 2 months, the unit failed to work","out of the box, it worked fine. after 2 months, if failed to work. absolutely nothing happens when you plug it in and turn it on.it makes no sense to return it for repair, because the warranty states that a $10 return shipping fee is required. add this to the postal fee for shipping the unit to be repaired and it is senseless to do so."
5,I LOVE this thing!,I am not good at doing my own hair at ALL and I don't like to spend a lot of time but I am actually able to use this tool no problem and within 5 minutes I have a salon look. It works wonders! I tend to get frizzy out of control hair after washing. I use this when my hair is dry and it smooths and adds a nice finished look to the ends. So my comments are that it's very easy to use and it works beautifully. I feel I get great results and it did not cost me a fortune.
2,Too much money for too little results,"The part of the product is that it does blow-dry the hair when rolled-up. However, it is extremely hot and I had trouble not burning myself. Also, the ""curl release button"" either broke right away or never worked. In the past, contacting Amazon about problems was too much trouble so I haven't bothered and just don't use the product. I hate to throw that much money away, but rather than spend time fooling around with it, I'll probably toss it."
5,Strong insights on military might and strategy.,"ON THERMONUCLEAR WAR was controversial when it was first published - and still is, today. No light reading, at well over 600 pages it packs in details from across disciplines and was widely read on both sides of the Iron Curtain: today its many insights on military strategies, issues, and the logic of amassing thermonuclear armaments still apply. It was the first book to examine the underlying logic of making and keeping nuclear weapons, originally created from a series of lectures, and provides both military and college-level collections with strong insights on military might and strategy."
5,"Another great ""Dummies"" Book","Me and my girlfriend were looking at getting Kittens in our Condo. Even though we decided not to adopt kittens, this book really gave me a lot of information on how to take care of them.This book is really easy to read and it has so much information inside. I love the ""Dummies"" books and this book will not disappoint."
2,"Movie sucks, strip scene is amusing",The movie as a whole sucks. The only redeeming aspect is a strip scene by the two male leads. They strip down to their black briefs.
1,Not charmed at all,"I'm glad I'm not the only one who was taken aback by this book. First, as a long-time cat owner, I find it hard to fathom that any feline would enjoy being shipped, time and time again, to new and frequently inhospitable locations; Henrietta would have to have been *very* unusual. And the Wrens manage to lose her in Cairo (somehow, she finds them again), then dump her off with relatives for a year when she becomes inconvenient. Another reviewer mentioned the atrocious ""since I'm an investigative reporter, I forced myself to eat cat in a Chinese restaurant, and it was kind of tasty"" anecdote. It's really miraculous Henrietta lived as long as she did."
1,I would give this 0 stars if I could.,"This is hands down the WORST purchase I have made on Amazon. I know, I know, you get what you pay for. Yet, I failed to see any mention of the fact that the sapphires would have visible chips, pits and cracks in them (one of the chips covers almost half of the sapphire). This was going to be a gift, but it's such a terrible piece that I can't imagine giving it to anyone. If you are thinking of buying this - save your money."
3,was ok,I was hoping for a better story and more action but it was not terrible. It waa too dull and slow for me.
4,Eye- opening,I found this book to be very graphic as well insightful. It inspires hope as well as courage. The book starts our hard to read but that is expected when it was written on Polish then translated into English. Once you get into the book though it really becomes quite an easy read.
3,Standard indie Japanese live-action-anime movie,"This is pretty standard indie Japanese live-action-anime fare actually, along the lines of Yakuza Weapon. Weird, crazy premise/storyline, cheesy sets, cheesy acting, cheesy action except this one has a booty-licious bikini clad maid princess to ogle. And for that the movie gets three stars. :)"
3,"Ok, it's supposed to be funny. I get it.","The entire story is about a woman seeking justice because the village chief kicked her husband in the jewels. It has its moments, but it left me with a ""what the heck was that?!"" feeling after I watched it. In retrospect, I cannot see myself ever watching it again, even though I wasn't disappointed and actually recommend it. It's just that the topic, while entertaining, has a hard time sustaining the duration of the movie. There's more to the movie, and yeah it has a statement on Chinese society blah blah, but you can't escape that the central theme is getting kicked.... However, Gong Li alone is worth a view.A far more biting commentary, and far better movie, is ""To Live"". That is an incredible movie rivaling any ""Best Picture"" nomination from Hollywood in the last 10 years."
2,"Sorry, I just found this to be boring propaganda","This film was obviously much appreciated by a great many people but I found it very boring.I usually enjoy foreign films and I enjoy thought-provoking films not action films.I loved ""To Live"" and enjoyed ""Ermo"" but I found this film dull as can be.The premise of the film is that a young woman's husband is kicked in the crotch by the local village chief for a perceived insult. The young wife protests that the chief was in the wrong and takes this grievance to higher and higher levels of Chinese bureaucracy.Personally, I feel the message of this film is that the Chinese government is very caring and is concerned about the lot of its most vulnerable people and that, moreover, the government is composed of very wise and uncorruptible men. I personally am rather skeptical!The only reason I didn't give this film one star is that it does have some presentation of life in a rural chinese village."
4,i think it works,"to be honest i can't tell if it makes a difference in taste, but i'm told you should do this every few months and this is a good inexpensive option"
5,The Girls Are Back!,"The girls are back, and they sound great!Following their first album 'Born', comes the new CD 'Shine'.If you love the girls, you will love this new CD.If you loved the first CD, you will love this one even more.It's a little stronger, and a little better, but still the girls."
2,Major disappointment,"I was transfixed by Bond 2 years ago. Born, both CD and Live at the Royal Albert Hall (RAH) were excellent. Last year I bought 50 DVD's for all my friends to help ""promote"" it. Shine, on the other hand, will have totalled one purchase. Something's very wrong with Bond. They went from RAH to sleazy UK clubs to teaching; their Web site is very disjointed; and Shine smacks of a Hollywood remake. James Bond theme was already released in their DVD. They've gone from being ""sexy"" Divas with world class strings coming first - to - cheap looking regulars. Nothing special anymore. Pity, really, and for an ex-pat I was proud to have them as another export."
5,Fabulous Four make great music,"I loved it. It is upbeat, fun, exciting ---- a nice change from the same monotonous classical we all have been listening to. A lovely combination fusing classical/instrumental/pop!5 stars! Can't wait for another (but not the remixed)"
5,"Bond have outdone themselves with ""SHINE""","I have both Born and I recently purchased Shine, this cdis by far the best of the two. I highly recommend thisnew music to any one wanting to here pure musical enchantmentand not processed studio music. I really enjoy kicking backto the great sounds of these four beautiful women!!!!"
4,"Good, but not better then the first","All in all a good album. It has a good mix of both fast and slow tracks. I have to say. number 11 ""Ride"" is incredible, the rest is up to par, but not anything spactacular."
3,"Great, but not as good as the first one","I purchased Shine since the first day it was realeased. It's great, but it's quite disappointing. The tracks in this album got ethnic influence with more pop beats that the first one. You can hardly hear the strings sound in this album-the girls didn't express their talent as much as they use to.Many tracks in this album is adapted; Led Zepplin's Kashmir, Strange Paradise and obviously Bond on Bond."
3,Elixir Bass String just okay,I was told by both manufacturers the Medium Strings would fit my G&L 2500 bass. The B string will not fit through body or bridge. I have purchased Elixir's before with the same problem.
4,Haunter's Showdown,"On this video there is an episode called Haunter vs Kadabra. I think it's cool because every time Ash goes to battle Sabrina Haunter runs away. Also in the video there's an episode called Primeape goes Banannas.In that episode Ash's hat gets stolen. I think it's pretty weird.I hope you like it. In the final episode, the Tower of Terror there are 3 ghost Pokemon. It's pretty awesome.I hope all of you watch it."
3,That's All?!?,"Umm...did they forget to print the last few pages or something? Good book, but a horrible ending. It seems that those several blank pages at the end of the book must have been meant to have a proper ending printed on them."
3,Good grade B picture,Just what I was looking for. I like cheesy B flicks and this is a good one. Lots of action. A fun film to watch.
2,SiN CitY rip off at best!,"Not sure what the other reviewers were watching? Not much depth to this at all same story as Sin City just a martial arts version and less thrill. Cinematography was fancy but the acting and the special effects, excecution were abysmal. Sasha Grey only appears 2 mins in the whole film not sure why she is on the cover. She has nothing to do with anything in the film. Dominque swan is only in the film 10 mins and has a small part. In Sin City he was seeking revenge for a girl named Goldie . Not sure why this was made in the first place but oh well."
3,enhanced standart definition,"a superb thrilling movie.The weakness is in the HD format which is slightly above average compare to a standart defintion.The gain in HD is good but not huge.Some scenes reveal HD ,some not...It seems that not the whole film is in HD.!!!The sound is very good.conclusion:it looks like that pre 2000 movie are not always suitable for transfer in HD due to lack of technology.That's explain a rating of 3 stars for HD reviewing."
5,Just like the Original,"When this movie first came out, one of the tv networks showed the first and last episode of the original series. I viewed the movie shortly afterwards and was impressed by the way the movie writers left the storyline intact, of course with present day updating. The Fugitive is one of many past television-series-turned-movie, and is one of the best; I would also suggest Mission:Impossible. I thought it was amazing that the entire series was summarized in 1 movie. Tommy Lee Jones is the perfect antagonist (as usual). This movie is wonderful; get the sequel US Marshalls to complete the set."
4,sets the stage for the series,"This is the first in the series of 5 books. The background is set, and prettymuch only one character is developed. If you start this expecting fast andfurious action, and a fairly easy read, then you will not be dissapointed.Pretty much everybody is a scoundrel in the book - it is only the depthof their depravities that varies. Overall, pretty good pulp fiction."
1,You will be a dummy if you depend on this book,"Sorry, I just cannot believe that the ""humorous"" and ""honest"" approaches recommended in this book will work. It all seems very idealistic, flaky and undignified. I value honesty (and humor too!) but there is also something to be said for modesty and decorum. I would find someone using these strategies very off-putting -- the words ""sense of entitlement"" come to mind. And I am not conservative. So what would a conservative employer think?"
3,still waiting to read,I haven't had much of a chance to read the book yet. But I will get to it soon. My husband and I are planning to move and get different careers or careers that interest more in the near future. thanks
2,Save Your Money!,"What a disapointment this book is! I had no idea. Yes it does have some beautiful photo's but I just don't think it's worth the money. You're better off subscribing to Country Magazine. Oh well - ""Live and Learn"" - I guess."
4,truth in a different flavor.,"This book is not east to read and Konner make it worse but stuffing it with his psychiatric diagnosis.However: if you are a physician you would relive a lot of the nostalgia through this book. He also does portray what goes on the surgical floor and medical floors. Surgical residents are a conceited lot and they eventually learn their lessons in the real world. I was surprised that he was so miserable on the medicine floors so early on, that usually takes a few weeks. and that makes me wonedr if he is one of the 'touchy feely ' doctors who's medical knowledge is 'on the ventilator' but make for it by holding everyone's hand through 'the harrowing times'.suffice to say, people in the medical field may like it, I'm not so sure with the laymen."
4,Do you want to become a doctor?,"Konner does a good job balancing the intricate details of his third year in medical school with the broader meaning of medicine from his well-learned sociological and anthropological perspective in ""Becoming a Doctor"". He lets you in on the medical ""culture"" that arises from the intensive year of training--the language used by doctors and students (see the Glossary of House Officer Slang), the sleepless nights in the hospitals, the life and death decisions/actions that take place. I highly recommend this book to someone who is looking into a career in medicine. It provides insight into the different areas of medicine, including Emergency, Obstetrics, Pediatrics, Psychiatry, Neurology, Surgery. But more importantly it probably provides a realistic peek into western medicine so that prospective students do not necessarily enter medical school bright-eyed and bushy-tailed!"
4,An autobiographical account of medical school,"This book was an excellent read. I am a pre-medical student, and Dr. Konner gave me a realistic view of the medical field and medical school. I have talked with and shadowed doctors, and their sentiments and observations closely match his. His views on what makes a good doctor influenced the way I feel about my future profession. I would recommend this book to any considering a career in medicine."
3,"If you don't want to go into medicine, read it","I've been through the whole works so the book was a little read to me as things are familiar. First, it really hit home on some chapters especially the surgical rotations. But as you read further and further into the work, I feel that the author has little positive things to say about medicine in general. Maybe he just want to bring up all the negative aspect of the field so that we are aware of the problem and address it. On the other hand, every rotations in the book has the author been [angry] about this or that resident or attending. I begin to wonder if Dr. Konner's attidude contributed to it. It doesn't go well for one's ego being advance in age and having to take orders from residents who are much younger then yourself. If you read inbetween the lines he does some brown-nosing himself.I recommend this book for anyone who is in the process of deciding whether to go into medicine (but leaning towards the ""no"" side)."
4,An enjoyable book on med school clerkships,"This is an especially good book for any non-traditional medical school prospects. If you're going to be doing your clerkships in your thirties you'll identity with Mr. Konner. And for those just interested in learning more about medical school, you could do a lot worse than this book."
1,Waste,"Sorry I orederd this...waste of money, buy a candle instead...Doesn't fit on a bulb containing a lamp!!!"
3,Explanation of La Communidad Latina in the United States,"This is not a sit down and enjoy book, but is proves to serve as a useful tool for research. Abalos teaches readers about what he refers to the ""core drama of life."" Initially, everyone begins in a state of emanation, may or may not enter into incoherence, and hopefully ends at transformation. He also includes a deformatory state of living, which, when an individual enters, he exits the ""core drama."" Because it is sometimes confusing, Abalos includes a detailed critique of some Latina literature and shows how his theory can be applied. This is definately a learning tool; it is not something to read for fun, but rather for enlightenment. Do NOT let the first two chapters stop you from finishing this book!"
4,Short But Sweet,"A bit of an interesting book in that it is only 84 pages. The heroine manages to go from being frightfully shy to being, while not overtly expressive, stronger on the inside, which is done in a believable fashion. One thing I liked was how the heroine befriended the brother of the man she ended up with before ever meeting said brother; this friendship gave new depth to the relationships all around. The brothers acted very realistically in regards to sibling rivalry and such. The only part of the book I had a problem with was that the herione's face was never referred to as such; it was always described using the word 'visage'. What, they couldn't have used face or even countenance once or twice?"
1,So short and we paid nearly $7. It was only 40 pages and the front of it says it only cost $2.99 at the stores.,So short and we paid nearly $7. It was only 40 pages and the front of it says it only cost $2.99 at the stores.
5,Awesome gate,"Bought this to keep our new puppy in the kitchen. Found it for a super price <$10, and thought I'd take a chance. It's high enough that medium/small dogs can't jump over it, and it's well made and study. Stays strong once locked in place. Super thrilled with this great buy!"
2,Beware of shattering,"This bowl held a large portion of cereal just fine. While washing it, I dropped it from less than two feet onto a tiled floor. It shattered into hundreds of very small (between the size of a grain of rice and a grape) and very sharp fragments. I cut my hands and feet several times while cleaning up the mess."
3,Love these bowls,I purchased one of these bowls to test it out because the price is pretty high. As soon as I received the bowl I knew I was going to have to purchase three more so I would have a set. The size is perfect and of course it is corelle so very tough. I tried to buy a cheaper bowl in the same size but wished I had just put the money out to begin with. I know they are expensive but worth it in my opinion.UPDATE....I have dropped this review to a 3 star as while at Target this weekend I found the exact same bowl for $4.99 each (I paid $8.35 at Amazon.
1,horrible,bought this for my nephew for his birthday.he tried to watch it when he got home.the dvd was tried in 3 different dvd players but the dvd was blank.thanks for ruining a little boy's birthday.
1,Stops working,"Conair hasn't figured out how to create a hot shaving cream product that works over time. It stops putting out lather, everything that can be done to make it work does not make it work, and it just will not force the cream from the enclosed can! This is a fundamental design problem and the company's engineers need to get back to work. A big waste of money, Conair needs some competition...."
2,A little too simplistic (for me),"I would recommend Your Memory: How it works and how to improve it by Kenneth Higbee instead. 10 simple things... are very, very simple. But, if you want an extremely quick read, I'd recommend it. :)"
3,"Expertly written, but cold...","This was my first foray into the work of Graham Greene. As a study on the ""thin line between love and hate"", it works quite powerfully. I just couldn't warm up to the characters. I found myself more interested in the novel's prose and it's theories of hate as the flipside of love than in any of the characters. Only the cuckolded husband, Henry, elicited any sympathy from me.I do though very much look forward to seeing the Neil Jordan film adaptation with Ralph Fiennes, Julianne Moore, and Stephen Rea. They seem to all have been expertly cast. Perhaps they can breathe some life into this cold, dispassionate world of the dead.I do recommend this book, but don't expect an emotional connection."
2,Anomalies,"There are 4 or 5 areas that MGM should ashamed of. The picture is distorted in a way which is quite awful to look at. The movie sound is fine, considering this was Goldwyn picture. I love this film, but MGM should clean up their act on this one. Either fix these areas, or take it off the market. The colors are wonderful otherwise. Buy it as I did, only if enjoy the film. I returned my first one, assuming it was an error in the disc, hoping the next copy would be better, but to no avail."
4,Classic Gut-buster,"My siblings and I caught this movie on Sunday afternoon TV once, and laughed until we cried. Very silly gags interspersed with hilarious one-liners make this oldie stay fresh. I'm not someone who generally likes classic comedy, and I LOVE this movie!"
4,Great Movie!,"I was delighted to find another Bob Hope movie I hadn't seen before. Great for kids. Pretty silly in the beginning but the last 10 mins are hysterical. Typical Bob Hope movie. Watched it with ""The Seven Little Foys"" so it was a great Bob Hope weekend!!"
4,Sedona Guide: Day Hiking and Sightseeing,"My wife and I spent about 10 days dayhiking in the Sedona vicinity. We found this guide much more satisfactory than any of the pamphlets or maps obtained in tourist information sites. The guide gives good directions to trail heads and lists them in catagories from easy to challenging, and from scenic to most interesting. An accurate discription of the hike and what you will see is also found in the guide. If you're not a hiker, there is also a guide to sightseeing spots accessible from roads. A short history of Sedona is included, and even a list of old Western movies that were shot in the area. I would recommend this guide to anyone who would be visiting the Sedona area."
5,Hard Rockin Band,"Super great band , first heard them in 78"" good heavy metal BandIf you like DeepPurple"" you will love Legs Diamond."
3,"OK, but it might affect your high scores",This past weekend we received a pair of these controllers and at first we were thrilled to avoid the hassle of wires snaking across our floor. We played the same games we normally play with the wired controllers and noticed that we were getting our butts kicked by the computer characters. Out of curiosity we plugged the corded controllers back in and tried again. The difference in control and accuracy was very noticeable and our scores returned to their usual levels. We have our TV set up in our guest bedroom and at no point are we more than 12 feet from the console; we were also sure to use fresh batteries. My guess is that this particular brand of wireless controller doesn't have the same level of accuracy we've become accustomed to from their wired counterparts. We'll be returning these and trying out the Wavebrand before we give up on wireless altogether.
2,Wireless ... when it works,"We have had these 2 or three weeks. We bought two at once so I could play with my son. Both of them are on the blink. The biggest issues is the joy stick controller. When new, the joy stick will produce movement in eight positions. One of them is down to producing movement in only 6 directions. No fun! They eat batteries. Maybe every 12 hrs of play. Somestimes, without warning, your character will start moving with the joystick in the neutral position. The only way to fix it is to take the batteries out. We have two units. Sometimes, one controler will move two characters. We are going to give wavebird a try."
2,"Dated material, unfortunately","The author has a nice start to the book. But is well behind the curve with many points. Specifically, the marketing ideas advanced were true 5 years ago - but coaches are resistent to these now because too many athletes are using them! Also, the SAT, ACT content is misleading. College coaches screen with this data and other academic data and to pretend otherwise is a real problem. Go with other up to date sources."
1,Looks like I got it off the garage floor.,"I was excited to see these and then when I finally held on in my hands it looked more like a flag I had used as an oil rag than an antiqued flag. Seriously, it looked more like an oil rag I had stored in the garage. A piece of cloth I didn't even care about, than a flag. It would look better if they had just evenly antiqued the whole flag than just thrown oil, or whatever they use on it."
5,Just as good and funny as the ones before,"Ever since I heard Bill's first CD ""Here's Your Sign,"" he has always been my favorite comedian, next to Jeff Foxworthy. Bills new comedy CD, ""Cheap Drunk: An Autobiography"" is just as good as his first comedy CDs. To be honest with you, the first time I listened to it, I couldn't stop laughing. Bill always tells the funniest stories about his wife and his kids. If you're a Bill Engvall comedian fan, this CD is a good one for you."
4,The Stage and School,It is a good resource for a beginning drama course. Good explanations of what theatre is about and why we do it.
3,its okay,"suitable for ages 7 and upok, i mean hardly any action compared to the rest of dbz, its kinda cool and exciting i hardly redcomend this!i realy recomend dragonballz the history of trunks, i wrote a review for it to, (13 and up, for blood etc. that is the history of trunks)"
5,One of anne's best!,"In my opinion this was one of anne's best. (Never haveing read any other of elizabeth's books I can't coment.) I wasn't to sure about it when I first picked it up, but once I started it I couldn't put it down. I am now totally looking forward to the next 2."
2,nice period piece; implausible solution,"The good news is that 18th century England is the perfect antidote to the hoity-toity victorian setting of so many other mysteries. The bad news is that although it has all the trappings of a classic puzzle mystery (including a locked room and a showdown at the end), the solution is so unbelievable that if I had thought of it myself I would have immediately discarded it. I felt betrayed."
4,A solid insight into real law-enforcement activities.,"A first-hand account of cases handled by a career law-enforcement officer. Each chapter is a different case. Hard to put down. I wanted to keep right on going. The book provides an appreciation for the behind-the-scenes work done by investigative officers, and the interrogation techniques that lead to confessions. An excellelent contrast to the unreal picture of law enforcement that we have been given in the popular media. I look forward to a sequel from the same author."
1,What a piece of junk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Purchased this scale from ITIN company and what a piece of junk this scale turned out to be! Had the scale for about 1.5 years and it does not weigh accurately and now I have a error code that cannot be reset. The book does not go in detail enough to reset the error code. The scale errors out at 38 pounds so you cannot weigh anything heavier than 38 pounds!Follow the directions to calibrate the scale and that does nothing to get rid of the error code. Emailed the company I purchased the scale from and because the one year warranty is up, they do not want to know anything! Asked for the manufacturer info and I was told China! Looks like I have no way of sending this scale anywhere to be recalibrated so it is going in the trash! Good chunk of money to spend on a scale that lasted 1.5 years and now because no one knows how to reset the error code the scale will now go to the trash! Thats what $209.00 plus shipping gets you!"
2,Wonder Washer,This product was advertised as new but it was used. It arrived in a box that was totally used and abused (I thought it was the fault of UPS) until I used it. It leaks water long after drained and was apparently returned to the store that I bought it from because of this. I read reviews on it before ordering but wish I had known how difficult it is after washing since you have to rinse and wring separately. It's less work to just hand wash altogether.
3,Dont get carried away,"Thia product is a good little machine. It works great for small amounts of clothes. I used it to wash my babies clothes as I did not want to use a public laundrymat to get her clothes washed. It works great as long as your expectations of what the machine can do is realistic. You wil not be able to wash comforters, large towels or a full size laod of dirty laundry, but if you have a few items that are not too big and bulky ( i.e. underwear, baby clothes, regular size towel, undershirts, socks) then it will work fine. The only thing I dont like about this machine is there is no rinse/spin cycle, so when the clothes are done you have to empty all the water and wring out each piece one by one."
4,Nice and practical.,"If you live in an apartment and don't have a car, this is good for small stuff. As big as a bucket, but be careful to not fill with too much water, as it will slosh out and make a puddle. Otherwise, useful."
3,"""Washer"" Being the Key Word","This is what is advertised, a washer. It does well with a handful of small items, tends to slop over if too full of water/clothing. Clothes come out nicely cleaned.But it only washes. It will rinse if one pours out the wash water, refills it, then turns it back on, then pours out THAT water. And of course the spin cycle is removing the clothes and twisting them manually to squeeze out excess water.Purchase only with the understanding that this washer requires lots of intervention so much so that some may prefer the sink. Other caveats: it's plastic, gives the feeling of something that can be bent out of shape or easily damaged if one is careless. Tends to vibrate a bit when at its capacity load. It can be heavy/cumbersome."
1,Look elsewhere,"There are better things you can use for doing a small load of laundry, ie a small rock. The one I have hangs up frequently and will even hang up with the bucket removed. For the small amount of laundry it can actually do, you would be better off with a large bucket and a stick."
1,What a waste,"I purchased the Wonder Washer August 16, 2011 and today, December 28, 2011, it died. No warning, nothing. I never used it for anything other than lingerie and light weight tops and skirts, usually once a week and for about nine minutes only. I just used it last week and it worked fine, the same loud motor, the agitation causing it to appear that it would tip over any minute, as usual. All that works now is the timer. It always did sound like it was not very well made and I would never recommend this thing to anyone."
1,NOT a WONDERful Washer,"With ""NO drain"" and ""NO spin/wringer"" capabilities, the filled unit must be ""lifted, dumped and refilled to rinse"" (with MANUAL wringing of items each time)! No better than a bucket and paddle, it is ""NOT a WONDERful"" washer. If you have strength problems with your back, arms or legs, DON'T BOTHER !"
3,No Wonder,"The product does as said, but it is too heavy to lift and pour the water out. In the 80's I had a washer but it had a plug to let the out. I only used once, and was disappointed. There should be a water line, so as not to go over, or put too much.My friends call it my toy."
2,Broken when received.,I opened this item to find one of the long standup wooden sided almost completely snapped in half where the crossbar is attached to it. Can't even say yet whether it's good or not; I'm ordering another because I really need this before Christmas and am hoping it's OK.
2,Mermaid card game,My three year old granddaughter and I played this one time and she wanted to quit in the middle of it. She told me to give it back to Santa Claus...she didn't want it. Think that says it all.
1,One Good song,The show is disappointing in that the dress changes were better than the music...so much talent not used
3,It was OK...,"I thought the concert was ok...she copied a lot of other artists on several acts..makes me wonder he original she is. The quality of the blu-ray and the sound is great though. I gave it 3 stars because of her performance and her lack of originality. But if you are a Beyonce fan, it's a great BLU-RAY...i happen to like most concert on blu-ray!"
2,the beyonce experience,video recording and quality is excellent but the music is not as classic as i anticipated.
4,My Daughter Loves Beyonce,I purchased this DVD as a gift for my six year old daughter who loves Beyonce. We sat and watched is Christmas night and she has had it in constant review since! Beyonce is a great and I can't wait to take my daughter to see her live!
3,Much Too Long,"No doubt, Miss B put on a heck of a show, but about 60 minutes in, I was done. It seems she tried to sing every hit she ever made and I grew tired of watching and listening to her. I think she should have left out the Destiny's Child material and the DC reunion. She's got boundless energy and visually she is quite stunning. The show was entertaining for the most part and her costumes were very pretty, except the one where she has the jewels on her bottom. I guess the editing was top notch as well, because I never heard her miss a note or lose her breath. There's one song, something about her flaws, that I really liked. I'd never heard that one before. The audience there for the taping experienced a real treat, but watching this 2 hour spectacle proved to be a chore for me. I won't likely watch this again."
2,Didn't suit my needs,"Pros: Small; AAA NiMh batteries so you can always have some charged and ready.Cons: Slow shutter, bad picture qualityThe small size makes this camera perfect for snap shots, but the slow shutter limits the types of pictures you can take. I tried to use it to use it to take pictures of my nephew but I have to predict when he is going to do something cute a second before he does it or else I'll miss it. I know I can lock the focus by pushing in the button a little then depressing it all the way when I want the actual shot, but then that means I or my nephew can't move or else the picture will come out blurry. I wanted this camera so I can take spantaneous pictures, but it's only good for poses."
5,Sony has done it again,"This camera is amazing. I've only had it for 2 weeks and I love it. I already have a 3.3 megapixel camera with zoom (Sony DSC-P1) so this was more of a ""pocket"" camera. Just something to throw in my pocket for ""everyday events"" that I want to capture.PROS:1) The size is the biggest - it will fit anywhere.2) Batteries - It takes two AAA (It came with rechargable ones) but in a bind you can get AAA's anywhere.3) All the features are there (red-eye reduction, index for taken pics, picture effects, etc....)CONS:1) There is no zoom - if this is going to be your ""first"" digital camera I would consider the somewhat larger but optically more advanced Sony's.2) 2 Megapixels - This is actually good and bad. 2 Megapixs is at the border of a ""good"" picture (IMHO). On a monitor, they look fine and they can be cropped slightly; but printing large pics or magging up too much gives a pixelly result. On the other hand, my 64 MB card holds over 120 pictures."
5,"Great acoustics, great sound, what an awesome album!","Live stages is one of the only live albums that I've ever heard that can truly capture the talent and precise excellence of the band that is playing, which in this case is the awesome Vertical Horizon. I can put this CD in and just let it play for hours. Every song on it is awesome and this album is definately worth buying!"
3,Disappointed,"This book was recommended by a friend and the reviews online were so enthusiastically in favor, I read it. Ho-hum--just another book about a disfunctional southern family with the requisite mother who spends her life in bed while her children raise themselves. Her children did an excellent job of raising themselves, however, and maybe that is the lesson to be learned. Not everyone needs a ""soccer mom"" and a ""corporate dad"" to amount to something. The book is a nice light read, but I didn't find much humor in it and I wish someone would write a book about the South that didn't portray the women as spineless, psychopaths. Scarlett O'Hara remains the only heroine who wasn't a doormat for every man she came in contact with!"
1,Boring and fluffy,"Only one person in my 10 person book club liked this book. The characters were not likable, there were too many cliches, the transitions between past and present were silly, the whole ""geechee girl"" thing was annoying rather than funny, there was not enough explanation of the Gullah language or culture, some characters were mentioned but not developed at all, etc. We had a fun book club meeting laughing at how bad the book was and wondering how it made it to a bestsellers list. Someone said ""Plantation"" was even worse."
5,Family Ties,"Sweet story about life changing experiences and friendships made in between. Also, the importance of keeping family ties alive during the good times and bad. I loved how Dottie meshed the past and present of the Hamiltons lives on Sullivan's Island. It reminds me that family is not just your parents,siblings, relatives, but people who made such a difference in your life and who you consider to be family. Her descriptions of the porch, beach, and house made me feel like I was at home and a family friend. I've already read Return To Sullivan's Island and loved it as well."
4,What a talented woman!,What a joy to pick up a novel with such a wonderful story! I couldn't put it down. And such HUMOR! Hope another one is on the way.....
2,So-So,I think you have to be from Sullivan's Island or at least from somewhere in South Carolina to enjoy this book. It was an OK read but not one I would recommend to friends.
1,Sullivan's Island,"This book was not well developed. Many characters were introduced, but were so sketchy that they remained simply names. Even the main character is someone that we learn little about. While the changes in story plot from 1963 to 1999 is interesting, we never have a chance to examine what happened to Susan in the interim. And then, what happened to her to change her from an overweight, stupid [but possessing two master's degrees -in what we never knew], easily manipulated slob into a slim, organized, wise, rich beauty. At the end, I simply wondered what happened? Too many of the characters, events and ultimately the book itself seemed to be unfinished."
4,A perfect trip to the beach!,"A great story about families, relationships, and just a hint of a ghostly presence set in the kind of place I would love to visit. It didn't take me long to fall in love with the characters and their house on the beach in South Carolina."
4,Curl up with this one,I happened to pick up this book from the picture on the cover. After reading it I was very happy that I did. Sullivans Island tells the story of a woman who after many years of marriage discovers that her husband was having an affair. She must now start a new life with the love and support of her older sister who still lives in the family home on Sullivans Island. While trying to put her life back together she comes to realize that she must find out the truth behind her fathers sudden death and the unhappy childhood that she experienced. Cheers to D. B. Frank. A wonderful first attemp at a novel and I am glad it was not her last since I went right out and bought Plantation.
4,"suspensfull,could it really happen??","Great Book! Easy,rapid reading,hard to put down.Although fiction,it sure makes you wonder--speculate,and the ending? well,thought provoking to say the least."
5,sports heaven,"The image quality for this DLP monitor is as good or better than any Plasma or LCD screen I've seen in the past six months! The high resolution (1080x1920) makes the nature shows and sports programs (i.e. football) quite enjoyable to view; plus, with HD and the 57"" screen, DVD movies are seen at a whole new ""speed"". So far, I'm impressed."
4,Love it,"First Tv arrived broke, could of happened from any retailer. Was replaced with no hassle it was appreciated kinda worried about an online purchase like this but after its said and done no complaintsTv is touchy though likes to find reasons to shut off but give it a minute it usually turns right back on. had it almost a year now never repaired it and i think its only picky in hot humid conditions so you have to spoil it with a cool room in the summer. Blu ray is breath taking on it got to love 1080p"
3,Having problems with my Mitsubishin WD-57731,"I bought the Mitsubishi WD-57731 from Amazon and at first I really loved it. But after the Manufacturer's warranty ran out. I had problems with my Lamp Driver. The WD-57731 wouldn't even turn on. I had to send it in for repair on 08/07/07, which cost me over $600 dollars. That isn't the first problem, because now I have a problem with the Lamp which needs replacing. And that happened yesterday 01/13/07, a fine way to start out the New Year.I sure hope this will be the last of my problems, because when it is working it is a really great tv but for how long???Get the factory warranty, you will need it."
1,Bad Customer Service,"If you live in Maine, don't buy this TV. You can't get anyone to come and repair it if you have a problem. I bought this TV 3 months ago and I noticed a spot on the screen. The service agreement say that if you have a problem with in 30 day they will send an authorized service tech to your home to fix it. I called and they gave me the number of two techs. One tech say that Mitsubishi doesn't pay him enough to come to my home to fix it, the other won't answer his phone. I am very disappointed. I have called Mitsubishi several times and I wait on the phone for 30 or 40 minutes. They try calling the techs and they get no response either. I am now waiting for a supervisor from Mitsubishi to call me back in 1 business day. 3 full months and nothing. I am at my wits end. I don't know what to do. Very bad service."
3,Cable Card,"This TV has a great picture, sound looks, you name it. However there is one problem with the cable card. I have had the cable company replace the cable card twice because it will not hold high difinition stations after several hours of use. Afterwards, I contacted the company where I bought the TV and they decided to replace it. Will see how the cable card works in the new one."
3,"Look out for clock issues, Great picture! Poor Tech Support!","I love the picture quality and functionality of this TV. I have owned it for 9 months. I noticed the clock wouldn't keep accurate time, nor would the auto clock set work or daylight savings auto adjust. Called Mitsubishi and their reply was that the clock is not meant to be accurate? They will not even try to fix the problem (within factory spec.). Menus, auto-tune and timer rely on accurate time. Clock looses 2 1/2 minutes a month. They told me to set the clock ahead a couple minutes to compensate? WOW!!!!! Best Buy Disagrees!!! They were told the same. They are now going to exchange the TV for a different one."
2,"STICK WITH MOVIES LIKE ""THE THING""",Another one of those CGI generated movies that is ultimately silly and about as scary as a pile of pups. THE THING BELOW has little coherence in its confusing plot; the effects are pretty cheesy considering what we have to work with these days and the actors are mired in a script that has no sense of suspense or terror. Viewers are never really told what this creature really is or how it manages to infiltrate the thought processes and create hallucinatory images. Further proof that they just don't know how to make a good horror flick these days. Stick with John Carpenter's THE THING if you want a good scare for Halloween!
1,Who the what the where the huh?,"This is a Great movie....for a drinking game! Everytime someone laughs they have to drink up! And with this movie, there will be alot of drinking!!! Even The highest B.A.C. reached by playing this game will be higher than the feckless mahu Okole Puka's IQ who made this Lapuwale work of art! Other than that, its Awe-some......Drink up!"
4,Good cod liver oil brand,This is a good high quality cod liver oil without the fishy aftertaste. It really works well and seems to work much better than some of the other brands I have tried.
1,Broken Bottle no reimbursement,"This bottle arrived broken, the postman came to the door with a box saturated in fish oil in a plastic bag. There is no way to contact someone at amazon to explain situation only a form that said to return the bottle for reimbursement. I did print out the form but did not know how I was to send that mess back."
4,The Difference that Made the Difference,"The challenge of cardcounting is not learning to do it, but ""conning"" the pit personnel into letting you do it.I was the stereotypical counter till I read this book (felt guilty, avoided contact with pit supervisors, neglected value of rapport with dealers). The result was very quick shuffles and even being told not to make any more blackjack bets.Since I have adopted the mind set described in this book and the resultant behaviors, (engage pit personnel in conversations that interest them, appear to play just for fun and the money means nothing, dress like you can afford to lose) I have enjoyed deep penetration into single decks for multiple hours at a time (the difference that makes the difference).I agree with the top authors on the game that this is the best book on casino comportment and developing your ""act""."
2,This Book is Not For Me,This book has good information however the projects appear to be a little dated. I was hoping the projects would focus more on sewing things for the home and not so focused on sewing garments from vintage linen.
5,Excellente!,"The easiest way to learn is through repetition...the songs are catching, easy to learn and the words are displayed at the bottom of the screen....it feats a trip to the zooo, the beach, supermarket, counting, the alphabet and more. So, this is a well rounded intro to italian for babies, kids and adults. Also, the pronuciation is excellent! You will learn alot of basics!"
1,Owned for less than 2 year and now major problems,"I bought this tv less than 2 years ago. My lamp went out November after 17 months. No big deal since we used it a lot. Now the TV only turns on once in a while after cycling the powere many times. The lamp light turns on but I know the lamp is good since I get the tv to turn on after 10 or so tries. Other times, the TV turns on with no picture and then shuts down with a blinking green light.Now I see that MANY other people are having the same problems for ALL MITSUBISHI DLP TVs. So many people are having problems there's class-action lawsuits. Mitsu customer service took my name and gave me the nearest repair center. They said it would be $300 minimum if it's what they think is wrong and then maybe more.Mitsu DLP TVs have so many problems you should think twice before purchasing. Your total cost of ownership is way more than the purchase price.Right now I just have a big black box sitting in my family room."
5,Excellent Book MUST read!,"Across a Hundred Mountains: A NovelThis is a wonderful story about a young girl and the troubles that fall upon her family when her father decides to leave in search of providing a better life for his family. The story is cultivating, emotional and dramatic. It can easily be read in a short time for those of us who love to embrace new stories and follow the characters lives closely. Overall, it is a great book. If you haven't read it already, pick it up and do it! I am sure you will not be able to put it down. I highly recommend it. So, I'm off to read her next book Dancing with the Butterflies and on to another adventure."
3,Good first novel,"The story is compelling and well told. The allegory is sometimes too obvious, yet the book speaks with a voice not heard often enough. The allure and promise of the US on an immigrant population that is exploited, ignored and vilified driven by poverty and lack of opportunity. These people of the Americas are the people who understand the true meaning of the American dream, and who suffer and die for what most Americans have long taken for granted."
2,ACROSS A HUNDRED MOUNTAINS,To a degree I found it revealing as to the plight of the Mexican poor. I did feel it was somewhat unbelievable in it's intensity. I found it very depressing and the writing amateur.
3,Across a Hundred Moutains: A Novel,"The book was interesting. An easy read, but seemed to be at a reading level that might have been appropriate for young adults."
2,Hatfields & the McCoys truth be told,"The last review I read on the movie I found to be helpful because I was debating on buying this film. I just recently read an exstensive article on the famous feud that shed a little light on the subject. For all these years all I knew was what was refered to as the ""yellow journalist view"". I decided not to purchase the movie because if I watch anything I want it to be factual. If anyone knows of a dvd, vhs or book that is fact-filled, I'd be grateful if you would post that information so I can get the real historical story. Thank you in advance = )"
3,Want to enthrall your woman??,"Chick flick, all day long. Women just love this film. Don't know why, but if they force you to watch it and you get through without ending up snoring, well hey, you're whipped and under their control. Fix that shed door!! Paint that garage frame!! Fix that pipe leak in the bathroom!! How dare you sit there and watch the football game when there are things that need to be done around this house!! LOL"
1,One of the worst pieces of sentimental garbage ever filmed,"I watched this movie on a long plane flight and I was greatly tempted to jump without a parachute. Don't get me wrong even though I'm a guy I like romantic movies but this is to romantic movies what Kenny G is to good jazz. They roll out every cliche in the book and then some. But then of course we at least have the subtle nuanced acting of Tom Hanks, unfortunately he doesn't come up to the high standard he set in Bosom Buddies. Oh for the days when TV actors couldn't make it in Hollywood and when scripts were written by writers rather than focus groups."
1,that lie?,"These days to buy this dvd an authorized seller of Amazon, my English is not very good and I prefer movies with subtitles or in Spanish, which is Latin for less than I am about to echo impulse buyer on this site and me ... but like the film or Spanish subtitles or ... less serious and more lies."
3,Sleepless in Seattle (10th anniversary edition),"I love the movie, it's one of my favorites. Only one problem--the voice & lip movments on the tape (around mid movie) aren't together. An it's to late for me to swap out for another one. My suggestion view the movie the day it arrives, not when you finally get a day off from work."
4,The Memoirs Of Sherlock Holmes,A really fascinating read. It makes you try to guess where the clues may come from. The detail and the logic lesson is terrific
4,The ultimate detective,"Some would say the detective story started with Poe. He may have started the genre, but never developed it, Sherlock Holmes defined the ultimate detective. Literate knowledgeable clever tenacious Many have added to his (or her character but never exceeded the mold."
5,was shocked,"was shocked how clear and crisp this speaker is, its a nice size and fits almost anywhere, deff would buy again and for the money u cant go wrong,"
4,Nice Sound,"This is a great speaker. It sounds nice and clear and seems to be good quality. The only complaint I have is that it is all plastic, even the cover over the speakers. This doesn't really bother me because it is behind my television but I could see how it might bother someone who was mounting it on the wall or something because the rest of my speakers are wood with cloth covers over the speakers (doesn't really match.)"
3,Every Mother Is A Daughter,"Surprisingly interesting book. Was fast reading and was enjoyed by our book club of ""ladies of a certain age"" and my 33 year old daughter."
5,Timely,"It is amazing to me how the conditions that led up to the ""Great Depression"" are similar to what led up to our current recession. I tell my family and friends that I was born (1931) at the beginning of a depression and may die in another one! What was the ""New Deal and Works Project Administration"" under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt are now ""Stimulus Spending and Corporate Bailouts"" under President Barak Obama.I love this book. It is typical of other ""idiot guides""--entertaining, enlightening, readable, and very informative."
4,"Great mix, except for two...","This album is a great mix of gothic rock, except for two annoying tracks that have no real place on this disc: Manson and NIN. But that can be remedied by hitting ""skip"" and moving on to bigger and better songs by Ministry, The Sisters of Mercy, Bauhaus, Love and Rockets, Peter Murphy, The Mission, etc.The best part of this album for me is the non-edited version of ""Haunted When The Minutes Drag"" by Love and Rockets. I lack ""Seventh Dream of Teenage Heaven"" so I had only heard the shorter edit of the song on various other compilations. When I heard it on here, and one of my favourite songs got even better and longer, I was thrilled.This is a good album for people with good taste in music, and if they can stomach listening to Manson and NIN, well, more power to them."
5,Reduce your Mathematical Illiteracy!,"Perhaps one of the best written books on Shewart's control charts and SPC. Written for the operational manager to reduce ""mathematical illiteracy"", the contents are non-technical, approachable and practical. Probably one of the finest introductions to SPC I have read. If you are a Six Sigma practitioner, it should be in your library. If you are intimidated by SPC, this will take the edge off."
3,mahjonng variety pack.,"didn't work on Windows 7. did work on old XP PC. bought it mostly for RahJOngg.Okay, but Irritating flashing browser."
4,Overrated,"I still gave them 4 stars because they're not BAD strings, but they are definitely overpriced. I don't get all this ""Nanoweb"" hype; they don't feel any smoother than the stock strings that were on my bass. Sound is good, a little bit brighter and twangier than I like, but not bad at all especially if you like that tone.While I'm happy with the strings, I certainly would not have paid $45 (I got the 5th string as well) if I knew what they were going to be like. To me DR strings are just as good (maybe better) and about $15 less."
4,"Nice, Old-Fashioned FillmI","Overall, this is a refreshing nice old-fashioned musical and a visual treat as well. I really liked the first part of this movie best with all the famous songs and great color that looks even better on DVD....and just a great feel of old-time wholesomeness.The story is just about two romances: the main ""contest:"" Gordon McCrae and Rod Steiger both vying for Shirley Jones, and the minor one with Gloria Grahame and two suitors. Grahame, with her humor as ""Ado Annie Carnes"" is the best character in the film, at least to me. Eddie Albert also chips in with some humor as the ""peddler"" and Charlotte Greenwood was good as ""Aunt Eller.""Jones and McCrae are about as ""All-American"" as you can get and Steiger is the lone ""villain"" of the film. The most colorful segment of the movie was the dream scene that featured a great set.If I could change anything with this film, I'd reduce it in length down to two hours, which is plenty."
4,Wait for the dual-version DVD disc,"Clearly there will be a ""special edition"" of this classic at some point, highlighting the Todd-AO and Cinemascope versions. Until that time, I'll hold off on buying this class film. I was able to see the Todd-AO version in the theater back in the mid-80s and was amazed what a great film this is."
2,ANY Excuse for a song?,"The music in this is, of course, absolutely wonderful. But the story and the acting are simply atrocious. It may just be that it hasn't aged well - and I AM willing to put up with bad acting and scripts to hear good music - hence my love for ""The Music Man"", ""West Side Story"", ""Oliver"", etc. But this exercise in stereotypes was just painful. Nice photography, though."
2,dvd mastering of these classic movies is a disgrace,"I received in one Amazon bundle four of the greatest American musicals written -- Oklahoma, Carousel, South Pacific and Gigi.Gigi is just sensational -- the anamorphic widescreen format presents a glowing, richly detailed picture. And it's great to switch to the French language option and hear the French singer Sacha Distel sing for Louis Jordan (though he's not credited).The Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals, courtesy of 20th Century Fox, are a disgrace, and not up to the quality of their VHS releases! Without anamorphic mastering, these widescreen releases lack clarity and visual punch; you end up noticing the lines on the television and groaning about the lost opportunity to present these great musicals in their highest possible quality. I suppose we'll have to wait for Fox to re-issue them anamorphically as 'special editions', and buy them all over again!"
2,not impressed with digital format,"*** comments are on the online purchase, Oklahoma is a classic that really doesn't need a review because it is amazing**** bought this on instant video format and it was weird- I'm sure there are terms that cinemaphiles or videophlies use but basically something about the cinematagrophy of the streaming video was off- tempo of the video was off like it was too quick sometimes and I think maybe it was remastered to the point where the images were too crisp or it threw off the depth perception of the image. At any rate, sorry I can't describe it that wee but I paid for the 9.99 online ownership and I think for something like an amazing classic like Oklahoma I would invest in a physical copy of the blu-ray. I just wanted to watch it instantly late at night so I went for the online purchase"
5,Wonderful Classic!,I loved this movie growing up and now I have the opportunity to share it with my children :) Very pleased
3,mightily disappointed in Todd-AO disc,"I recently saw the (supposedly) last surviving Todd-AO print at a theatre in Minneapolis, and the vibrancy and clarity were striking.I was expecting the same from this DVD, but was shocked at the poor quality transfer. Not only does it look out of focus, but the color fluctuates as well. At one point the blue sky turns white!The Cinemascope disc is markedly clearer, but still not as good as it should be, IMHO.I still love the movie, but this set is a disappointment."
1,Not as great as I expected,"I was so excited to see this movie, my husband bought it for me and I have always heard so much about it that I couldn't wait! I love musicals and I own many. But this one was a disapointment, the ballet was done poorly and the dream sequence...ARGH!! horrible! The plot was lost in the dancing. Musicals are great! I love them! But go watch singing in the Rain or Seven Brides for Seven Brothers! This movie kinda sucked the life out of me. I had to watch Harvey Girls after it just to cheer me up! (oh, and this movie isn't even filmed in Oklahoma, It's filmed in Arizona.) review written by~ Miranda Sutton."
5,OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOKLAHOMA!,"I was in the show on stage... I love the show on video! Though it lacks some of the personal attributes that are gained through the stage version, one can't help but to admire this motion picture. It's GREAT!"
5,Clearing up Todd-AO/Cinemascope/video/DVD confusion,"I found the information on the two video and the DVD releases confusing, even after reading the comments here, because the terminology is sometimes scrambled. In theatres, both Todd-AO and CinemaScope versions were shown, both widescreen. The Todd-AO is 2.20:1; I don't know what the CinemaScope was (maybe 2.35:1). I have deciphered the various pieces of information, and determined the following (1) original P&S video (not widescreen) was based on the CinemaScope version, (2) laserdisc version was based on Todd-AO version, (3) newer widescreen video was based on Todd-AO version, and, the one that interested me the most, (4) DVD version was based on the Todd-AO version. There appears to be no widescreen version on video, laserdisc, or DVD that's based on the CinemaScope version. The video and audio quality of the DVD is outstanding. My only complaint is that it's letterboxed full-frame, not anamorphic. But, great nonetheless."
1,What's going on here?,"In response to the missive from 20th Century Fox posted on down that the Todd-AO version was in such a bad state that even running the film through a wet gate could not bring it back to life, I say, give me a break! Think about it, the TODD-AO version sat in a vault for 40 years until a stunning version was made for the Laser disc market in the mid-1990's. And then in the last 10 years, with the studios more aware than ever of the (financial) importance of film preservation, the TODD-AO version was allowed to lapse into a state of disintegration. Who's kidding who? Hey Fox, how about pulling the other leg, why don'tcha!"
4,"Not their best album, but still good.","Let me start by saying Soilwork is one of my favorite bands. With that being said, This is not their best work. It is more of a transitional album from their heavier material to their more melodic work of now(which is still very heavy). But NBC is still worth buying just for the fact that it is Soilwork."
5,My favorite Soilwork album so far!!! 5 stars x 5!,"Im always looking foward to a new Soilwork release. These guys I can just really identify with both lyrically and musically. Natural Born Chaos is the follow up to 2001's A Predators Portrait (which was a BLISTERING and AMAZING album) and what most Soilwork fans consider to be their best.Natural Born Chaos (produced by the muscial genius from SYL, Devin Townsend) starts off with the engaging and speedy track, Follow the Hollow. Its pretty much non-stop from there. The songs keeps a good momentum flowing and the instrumental work is wonderful. Every song on this album is a masterpiece and every listener of this album is bound to be able to pick one out that they can relate to. If you were a fan of A Predators Portrait then you will like this one."
4,Decent,"Soilwork is a very decent band. I can't say the best one but still up there... If you like melodic deathmetal with clean vocals and keyboards then you defenaly like them! Wondering how they sound like ? mmm, at least what comes to My mind again My mind is ""in-flames"" , ""archenemy"" , ""cradel of filth "" , ""dummy borgir"" because they all use keyboards and their all melodic!Any-ways, i think their pretty good."
5,Anders' best so far...,"This is Anders' best so far. Very strong lyrically and his guitar playing is in top form. A dazzling array of musicians and voices (Johnny Vidacovich, Tommy Malone, Theresa Andersson, Keb' Mo', Leon Medica, et al) make this a must-have."
4,Great album!,"Not as good as ""Coming Down"" but a great bluesman in his own right! Also check out ""Black Eye Galaxy"""
5,The child of Muse,He is the one of the greatest artists in the world today. This one is extremely well-done. Beautiful and peaceful. How many tired people are watching this page? Are you looking for something makes you be relaxed? You should listen to this. You can find this album shares your too busy life or lonliness with you.
5,raincan adjustable shower head,"This is by far, the best shower head I have ever owned. It adjusts from a soothing rainfall to a pulsating massage shower with six other settings. I am 5'9"" and it clears my head to give me a real rainfall experience. I do not think I would be able to go back to an ordinary shower head."
4,Great shower head,This shower head is great. Installation is really easy. It looks great. The only complain I have is that the lever wheel that changes setting is hard to move.
2,shower head,"this shower head looks great but doe NOT function like you would think. We have great water pressure and even taking the ""water saver"" out the water trickles out making rinsing shampoo out of yoyr hair a nightmare. I dont like it at all."
3,This book contains a very interesting historical perspective on love.,"Ovid supplies his experiential perspective on love and its managementfrom a time long past, but it appears, with some exceptions, to be currentin a good bit of its advice."
3,Readers will need a well-developed understanding of Greek and Roman mythology to profit from this book,Interesting in that Ovid points out - purely unintentionally - that over the centuries there has been little change in human nature. Much of the advice he proffers speaks to contemporary sexual relationships.
3,Holster not made for expensive flashlights,"I recommend you buy this item if it was to hold something inexpensive. I bought this as a gift and that person told me the product itself is not smooth so it will scratch up anything you put in. Overall the shipper, shipped out the item on time."
4,RunAway Quilt,"Have enjoyed this book, but found the story line harder to follow than the other books of Jennifer's"
4,The Runaway Quilt,I enjoyed the history aspect of the story and how it tied into the other story in which the Runaway Quilt was mentioned.
5,"A simple book, a simple review","I bought this book when I got my first dog of my own. My family have always had dogs but had always been content to get as far as ""sit"" and then let them do what they wanted. I wanted something more from my dog and suspected what was confirmed by the book: that a trained dog is a happier dog. I've recommended the book to countless others and am about to order it as a gift for someone who recently got their first dog. I hope that it will provide him with as much insight as it gave me and I can assure you that you'll gain plenty of tools, both practical and thoughtful, from this book. More than just giving you a series of instructions, this book will help you to have a little more of an idea of what's going on inside the canine head. And McMain manages, in spite of the obvious love that he feels for dogs, to strip away some of the sentimentality that often clouds our relationships with our dogs. I offer him my thanks, and if he could, I'm sure that my dog would too."
2,Dissapointing.,"We replaced our Labtec computer speakers with the Bose MediaMate computer speakers, having bought them as a Christmas present for my husband. After hooking them up, we were completely disappointed with the sound. They distort at a very low volume level and are completely lacking in bass response. We're sending them back and reconnecting the Labtec speakers. They were half the price and sound significantly better."
5,Advocates Of The Theocratic Rule...,"The Cross Movement stays true to the word of God without compromising the rhyme or the beat. All the lyricists have their own respecitve styles and they don't come off whack or too preachy. Too bad T.R.U. L.I.F.E. and Cruz Cordero got kicked out of the group. I hate to be biased, but I think Ambassador is better than any of the other guys hands down. He sounds like ""the missing Wu Tang member"". Listen to the Philadelphian/New Yorkian accent and you'll see what I mean. Excluding the group songs (two nice efforts, by the way), my top 5 solo songs are ""Human Superstars"", ""Off The Hook"", ""Just 4 You"", ""The Rescue"", and ""Playa Hata #1""."
5,No problems here!,I bought this product for my father. The product shipped quickly and was well packaged. He said they were great and just what he needed. No complaints here!
2,Cable didn't work,"I lost my usb cable to the Philips GoGear MP3 player and needed a new one. I hooked up the player to my computer and saw an error message stating that there was an unidentified device hooked up to the computer and to retry or replace the device. Ok so I triple checked the connections and tried again...same problem. I went to the Philips website and downloaded the latest driver...same problem. I contacted Philips tech support, no help. I tried another computer, still not working. I contacted GoMadic and they asked me in a series of emails if I had done all the above mentioned trouble shooting steps. I responded to each email that I had done so. I got an email stating I would get a new cord in the mail...never arrived. On the bright side, I can use the cable to charge the device, I just can't upload/download music. Sigh...I guess I need to get an I Pad or an I Phone."
3,A Useful but Inconsistent Collection,"This book is a compendium of 3-5 page biographies of each of the 55 delegates to the Constitutional Convention of 1787. It is a useful book full of good information, but that said, it is all information that is readily available in numerous on-line biographies of the Constitutional Delegates. The book puts it all in one place for you, but in no greater depth than that easily available elsewhere.The delegate biographies are inconsistent in content. Some, for example, will include notation of military service, others not. Follow-up research often indicates omissions are oversights. Wives are not always mentioned by name, sometimes not at all. Slaveholders are sometimes pointed out, but with poor consistency. In the end the reader is never quite sure whether or not absence of information is indication of the negative, or insufficient research... which puts you back into the same web-searches that you bought the book hoping to bring to an end."
3,For some but not all,The book was very informative but not in what i was expecting it to be informative in. Unfortunately i had a lot of difficulty getting into this book and enjoying it and eventually just gave up on the whole experience. I am sure that for some this book would be fantastic and very enjoyable but for me it seemed to take to bland an approach.
3,Thrills but predictable.,"Buy this book if you like sailing, but don't expect much insight into character, or a plot that leaves you constantly guessing. Proper cliff-hanging perils for the heroes, but quickly dissipates. Nevertheless an enjoyable read for an airplane or stuck in a waiting room. Not up to the author's better work."
1,WARNING - Not the original release,"I was very disappointed. I'm usually not into this type of movie, but I enjoyed this movie twenty years ago when it was on Showtime. Not only are there NO chapter menus, they've editted out some of the nudity that made this movie stand out in the genre."
5,You get what you pay for,"I expected hard, heavy compliations on this and that is what i got. This is some of the best heavy music around today. For those who say it is not real ""rock"". It is what rock has turned into today. No it is not Jimmy Page or Lynryd Skynrd. The return of rock isn't classic rock, it is basically something new. I do wish RATM would have been included. But this cd doesn't let down. I love all kinds of rock, from the Beattles to Slipknot. So i recommend putting this in your collection, It truly is one of my favorite albums. Staind and Machine Head have some damn fine songs on this. So get the CD and go body slam someone."
1,MTV FAILS AGAIN,"Before you read anything else read this, a lot of these artists are really good, Slipknot and Sevendust being my favorite but MTV the So called ""Music Television"" which has about 30 minutes of music a day, and an even smaller percentage of which is worth listening to tried to put out a cd which in my mind doesn't do justice to half the bands on it. They think they can go from being Hanson and BackStreet Boy lovers to having a cd with Slipknot on it without raising a few suspicions they were wrong. This is just another attempt of MTV to make a few more dollars. They took some of the worst songs off of certain cds and labled it THE RETURN OF THE ROCK? I admit, I watched the return of the rock show whick happened to be on at 12:00 at night a couple of times, the first time I watched it, it was ok, the second I noticed that 90% of the songs on it, were on the night before? Yet only 10% of the bands on this cd were on it. To sum up, DON'T BUY THIS CD."
1,"no book, don't need it now","this site like numerous other must have been written by aliens, the dumbing down of the internet, three more words"
5,Couldn't wait to get the sequel!!!,"The second I finished this book I was calling up bookstores asking if they had the next one. I highly recommend this book! If, like me, you found yourself hating the first half of the book, keep at it, you'll love it at the end and be begging for more!!!"
2,...must try to stay awake....,"I bought this book based on all the hype I've heard from other people and from reading so many favourable reviews. I should have saved my hard earned dollars... I must agree with the few enlightened critics out there who complained about the ""yawn factor"" when it comes to reading this novel. I could only read 2/3's of this book before I couldn't take it anymore. The story moves too slowly! The only reason I read as much as I did is because I felt I should at least try to get something from this book after spending money on it. If you love long drawn-out descriptive fanatsy novels that meander about the place without really getting anywhere, buy this book NOW!"
4,Start of a great epic fantasy series,"I just read Dragonebone Chair for the second time (first time in almost 17 years!), and was really blown away about how carefully constructed Williams constructed the world of Osten Ard. When you look at the various nations, and the clear parallels they have with other nations in our world it gives the series more depth. I had missed this the first time I read through, and a second reading does wonders here. I do remember when I first read this book thinking that nothing happened in the first 200 pages-what a foolish thought that was, huh? ;) Seriously, Williams builds a tremendous tale and leaves you begging for more in the second book in this series."
3,eh...,"Just a little backround on authors I've read - Jordan, Eddings, Brooks, Goodkind, Haydon, and others. My two cents is that all the reviews aren't too precise on how slow the beginning of the book is. The first 160 pages is of Simon's boring life in a castle. The next 150 pages is his boring journey. Then afterwards, it gets slightly interesting. I must emphasize the word ""slightly"" because there was not much action. I mean, action doesn't necessarily make the book interesting, a surprise or out of the ordinary event would help. But unfortunately, none of that until the last 50 pages of the book. Add other people's criticism and there you have the book. Since I've started, I am compelled to finish the series since I don't like to leave things hanging. My word of advice is to read this book only if you are extremely bored and have nothing else better to do."
3,"Dense, formulaic, and long.","I appreciate fantasy book that takes a while to read, and certainly TDC isn't a one-night book. I also like that the book's magic system is not completely insane, that there is great historical detail, and apparently a well thought through plot. Nevertheless, I'd have to disagree with the great majority of reviewers, who thought that this book was ""the best book ever,"" or that ""the characterization was amazing."" This is a better than average start to a better than average fantasy series. Cliches about: the princess disguised meets the peasant-with-a-hidden-destiny-on-a-quest; the mentor dying with a secret; the dwarf-like creature(think Gimli); the swords. But who cares? Its fun, its worth the money (you can easily buy it used at most good used stores, and certainly could get it at remainder prices), and it take a while to read...But a five star book? I'd reserve that for George R.R.Martin..."
5,Read this book.,"All I have to say is that if you enjoy fantasy novels, this book (part one of a trilogy) is for you.It is absolutely one of the the best books I have ever read - and I have read quite a few.It's one of those rare books that you don't want to end. You really should read it."
3,"Starts off slow, but the series as a whole is Wonderful.","I am just finishing up the series, and I must say it is a very good series of books.After the first book, I would rank the next 3 books all 4.5 stars. However, the first book starts slow. I almost put it down around page 250. But I'm so happy I kept going. The series was great.If you are a Fantasy lover, and can endure the first 350 pages, you will not be disapointed. The plot line is great. The male characters are very well developed and likeable. The great evil is very detailed and complex.Other than the first 300 pages of the first book being slow. My only other gripe is that some of his female characters, especially the young women, seem very shallow and self absorbed. Other than a few minor women, this was a dissapointment.Despite a few minor flaws. This series is defintely a great read!"
1,very poorly written,"I persevered for almost 100 pages. By then the direction of the plot was still unclear. It's like the author just finished reading ""Similes & metaphors for Dummies"" and couldn't wait to spin bunches of colorful and confusing comparisons. The author is definitely in his own fantasy world, but gives the reader very few opportunities to go along with him. Some passages are so loaded with excess verbage that I had to stop and re-read them even to get a vague idea of what he was trying to say. Don't waste your time or money. Spend your time and money on RR Martin or the Eragon series if you want great writing and memorable storylines."
2,Overly slow and detailed,"I kept slogging away the first half of the book but it is overly detailed and tedious. I did finish it only to feel like the story had just began. Tad Williams needs a much better editor to trim the excess and he needs to bring some kind of completion to each story even if it IS the first of a trilogy. I will not be buying the rest of the set. The story was just starting to really take off when the book is chopped off. I know he wants to get readers hooked and sell more books, but I felt I put a lot of reading in for very little satisfaction."
1,what a load of.................,"Rubbish. The text seems to have been poorly translated into English from -probably- Italian, judging by the mistakes. I saw this book on remainder a few weeks after it was released.Stone's Glossary remains a vastly superior book, despite this volumes claim to be intended as a replacement."
1,READ THIS TO SAVE MONEY....,Ok i bought this thinking it would be good and add a new dimension to my sound....well it did a very crappy one..its either on or off theres really no adjustableness to it...they said its a great tone booster well its not maybe a great humm booster....so if you play beach boys stuff buy away but if your a real guitar player buy something else.......
5,Great Product,Great Product. Smaller than I imagined it would be. Shipped promplty. Recommend purchasing to anyone looking for something like this. Even had grease on the copper contacts prventing corosion.
3,My least favorite Berenstain Bear book,"I love to travel, even with the problems. I hope my children do too. This book tells the tale of poor planning on Papa's part, but the family isn't able to make allowances for the annoyances that come up. I don't like the message that the Bears are better off at home than in a cabin in the mountains.Fortunately, they do laugh at themselves later, and I certainly hope they try again."
1,60 Pages with almost nothing !,"First, Amazon should allow ZERO Star Vote, that's how I would rate this manual.Approximatively: 60 US-letter pages, printed only on one side , 12 introcution and advertising pages, 15 with simple graphics annoted by hand, 15 with a few lines describing the graphics, and some thin explanations. This method can be explained in a line : buy trending stocks and use stop-loss ! Woaa Thanks.And how to find trending stocks can be discovered in any good Technical Analysis book explaining ADX, Stochastics, and other TA indicators.See what -A reader from Houston, TX , April 30, 1999- is saying...At more than 1$ a page that's the holly grail for the author! Buy some good books on AT like Murphy, Schwager, Pring, Blau, etc and you'll get all you need to find trendy stocks. A really disappointed buyer... or should I say a victim ?"
3,Quick read,"As the title states, he gives you a simple pullback type of method based on two indicators. The logistics of is is solid and I have no doubt it can be profitable over time with proper money management. You may be better served just to check this out of the library, as it is quite simple and can be typed up in half a page."
3,It will be a simple but useful system.,"An expensive book. But value is not depended on its cost. It actually provide a simple but useful entry method to you. However, is it a holy grail or super trading system? Certainly not! Useful method will only provide its goodness when using it properly (eg. using good money management) Having read many many books I didn't find any special power on all of them. But if you really don't have any trading edge method in hand, read it."
2,Slow going,"I have always been fascinated by the history of the science around World War II. Some of the most important inventions of our world (radar, encryption, computers, ...) were created or spurred on in this era. Yet somehow this book manages to make what should be an exciting and fast-moving story slow and turgid. It suffers from a fault more usually found in autobiography than history/biography, namely bogging down in extended dull backstory of the principal actors before getting to the relevant subject matter. (Katherine Graham's autobiog is an even worse example, but worth wading through). This book could comfortably have been 100 pages shorter and still delivered on what its title promises."
4,The bassinet is great,"I should preface this by saying we have only used the bassinet part of this stroller. We have the black stroller and it looks great and feels like quality. We have never event taken it outside. We use it inside so that when baby is sleeping during the day we can move him from room to room and this has made our lives much easier. I don't think I would like this stroller as an everyday stroller because it is wide and takes up a lot of room in the car and doesn't fold up compactly. It has no cup holders which I would like (but the handlebars do fold down which is nice when you are using it as a bassinet). The basket underneath is pretty small and doesn't hold very much junk and that could be a problem since we all know how much stuff babies and toddlers require. This stroller manuevers great and would probably be a great stroller for outdoor jogging and what not. So depending on what your needs are this stroller is very good. Overall, very satisfied."
3,"While I am totally tepid about this movie, my wife L O V E S it.",I have successfully managed to avoid watching this DVD since it arrived in the mail . . . BUT my spousal unit has watched it several times. I have always considered the movie to be oddly stylized and stilted even for a Shakespeare flick BUT it was a visually appealing version.Oh yeah . . . Michael Keaton is brilliant in a brilliantly quirky role and Keanu Reeves plays his proper role as the villain of the story. Yada-yada . . .
5,My Favorite Love Story,"Many find William Shakespeare's Romeo and Julliet to be their favorite love story, but after seeing this movie it won me over. When you read his work after you see this movie it feels more exciting.I enjoyed reading A Midsummer Night's Dream, but I haven't seen the motion picture, yet. This was also another great love story with colorful characters.His colorful characters are one of the reasons why I love his writing so much. They have personalities; they have life. When the protagonists take too much of the story it gets boring, but when you have a rich melting pot of characters in which their lives all meet at some degree its a lot of fun.In this movie you see song and merriment of the Mediterranean countires. Many courtships arise and the strenght of love, faith and trust are put to the test. See who wins and see who fails and see who gets a second chance."
4,Very Entertaining,"This movie really took me by surprise. I guess I was expecting it to be dated and more serious, but in Shakespeare fashion it was quite entertaining and timeless. It was a brilliant take on a classic. Enjoy!"
2,I have read better,"I am a big fan of the Forgotten Realms and I have read most of the published novels and found the majority to be worth reading, but this particular novel was a little tiresome.The story revolves around an accused thief who is given a second chance at life if he will find a certain noble who got lost in Undermountain. Artek The Knife is the thief's name and being boring is his game. Artek is half-orc on his father's side and this is the only interesting thing about him. The other characters fall short in most respects, except for Muragh the talking skull and Guss the Gargoyle. Muragh provides comic relief in the story and Guss shows great bravery. The noble and Beckla the mage are not that fascinating.I believe if the characters were more developed this would have been a better read, but they were not and this is not."
4,great book for children,"War Horse is a well told story, with decent character development. As an adult I enjoyed reading the novel, but it's better suited to readers in their middle teens."
3,Read it because of the movie,"I ordered this book after seeing the movie. I didn't realize it was written as a childrens' book, but I would still have ordered it. It's fairly accurate to the movie, but leaves out some of the gory details and embellishsments. It's an easy read which goes quickly."
5,Great Servce,The book arrived quicker than expected and in perfect condition. A simple telling story regarding a horse tale in the last day of the British Calvary. Told thru the eyes of the horse.
3,War Horse,I purchased this for my son who is an avid reader. He said that this book was an ok book to read. It's written about a horse back in the war days. Joey gets sold to the Army as a work horse; he wonders if the war will ever end???I would use Amazon again for my shopping needs. They put customer service first and take pride in the way they ship out products. My items came to me in execellent condition! Thanks Amazon!
5,Heartwarming,I loved this book. I am an animal lover and this book just warms your heart. This story pulls you in and you feel connected to Joey.
5,None,"War horse is my most favourite book.I first really heard about it was when I started seeing the ads for the movie on the T.V. I love the way Michael wrote the book and how to me was as if I was there watching with my own eyes.I love the books Michael Morpurgo writes, I have War horse (of course) on my Kindle and I got Mr Nobody`s eyes as a normal book and I really want to read Long Way Home. He is a great writer and I hope he keeps on wrtiting.I reckon 5 stars, amazing book"
3,"A good read, but don't look for much else.","Warhorse follows the tale of Joey, a young horse sold to the British Army in the early stages of World War I. While he initially rides with the cavalry, he eventually is captured by the Germans and used a work horse. This story is a quick and easy read for most and I would recommend it for anyone trying to find a book for late elementary/early middle school aged child (especially if they love animals). However, older readers may find this story to be a bit boring and there is not much here for teachers if they are looking for a novel to teach. That being said this would make a great addition to any classroom library."
5,Excellent,This book was an excellent read. I did it in two (2) days. I can't wait for the movie in December.I loved how the story is told from the horses point of view. Very well done.
4,Great gift,This book was purchased as a Christmas gift for a horse lover. She has already read it and really enjoyed it. Quick read. Now would like to see the movie.
5,"Awesome, Awesome and more Awesome",This is a wonderful book and a great story. I can totally see why they made it into a movie. It is full of suspense. It is really nice to hear a story about a war hero. The relationship between Joey and his owner is magical and a heartwarming tale. The way all the people work together to help them is a true testament to the human spirit.
4,"War Horse, the book","Well, for sure I enjoyed the book. I saw the movie before reading the book and was pleased that the story-lines were so similar. I understand the book was written as children's literature, however, that meant, for me at least, that it was a quick read and an enjoyable read. Go for it...buy the book and have a great read."
4,War Horse,"Absolutely loved the book. Courageous, heartfelt and truthful. An unbiased outlook on war, touching, men hardened by deprivation of war, reaching for one symbol of hope and recognizing in the war horse true valour.Read the book before yo watch the movie!"
4,No opinion,I haven't read it yet but my husband read it and compared to the movie was disappointed..I will read it and draw my own conclusion.
4,war horse,Enjoyed reading this book after seeing the play. Would recommend this book not only for young people but also for senior persons like me.
5,"War Horse is not only for ""young adults""","This is a wonderful, engrossing tale listed as a novel for ""young adults."" Any adult should enjoy reading this engrossing tale, told by the horse of the title, which is a strong anti-war novel."
4,when you need just a little something,"lipton cup-a-soup, broccoli & cheese flavor, is just what you need when you aren't really that hungry, but need that little something. its perfect. fast , easy , very good, and satisfying. its a kind of comfort food with out the mountains of calories, or spending all day cooking. its portable too! just as easy at work as at home. doesn't take up much room in cabinet or desk. the single servings are just what you need. make one, or share and make more. i really do love this product."
1,over rated,Elixir sucks! I don't know how they got their reputation. they buzz. they break. they do not last. they are house brand guitar strings at best. their fancy packaging and hyped up reviews (that they probably pay people for) are not worth it. buy anything else.
5,Awsome deal!,I truly love these strings and to get them at this price was truly a great deal. I am fully satisfied with the price as well as the time for shipping. I usually do not write reviews for products but this product is absolutely top of the line. Great deal!
1,DVD Tray Too Wide,"I was unable to use this DVD drive and had to return it because the tray is too wide. Most DVD drives give you about a 1/2"" clearence on the sides, but this tray gos compeletely to the edge. Once I put the case back on the computer, the tray could not eject. If they would redesign the tray to be more compatible with Dell PC's and others, then this would be a good drive."
2,I disagree!,"I have tasted the entire line, and this was the only one that I was disappointed with. With a name like ""Mate Chocolatte,"" I expected chocolate or cocoa flavor. If there is any, it is awfully subtle. It is still a decent cup of mate, it's just that the other flavors in the line are true to what they claim to be -- mint, orange, chai, red. You can read an extensive review of the line here[...]"
2,Sizing is off,"I measured my knee around the bend and then ordered this is the coordinating size, which was recommended on the site, and it is way too large. It falls down my knee the moment I put it on. Going to have to return it and had to go out and purchase a more expensive one in town."
1,I would of given it 0 stars...,This is retarted! I Waited more than 1 week. And I get a toy like this! I don't like it. I pushed the blade in and the sound and lights don't go off! I have 2 other spring action light sabers and they're a lot better. My friend had the same problem.
2,Just Don't Know,"I thought when I read about this, it would be great for my toddler to have his drink cups in this. Yes, it does fit the smaller juice boxes but it slides around and is short inside making it hard to drink from the straws because as anyone with kids know, those straws are never straight up in the air. So you are constantly pulling the straw up but you have put your fingers down inside the container of this holder."
5,Steve,I want to say I received this item - and the pictures do not do it justice. I could not be happier with my purchase -- It keeps the crumbs from going all over the floor and on JR. This is a great item! My only probelem is that I did not create it first!
4,Great item with one very small problem,"The Crumb Chumb bib really does its job well. It's very lightweight, easy to clean, and catches a lot more food and drink than the other bibs. I would definitely recommend it. The very small problem I refer to is that my toddler has very sensitive skin on the back of his neck and the velcro closure definitely irritates it. I have to wrap a paper towel around the closure to keep this from happening."
1,Not durable,This is a great bib but it has just one problem: the water-proof backing starts to peel off after it has been washed several times.
4,Better metal,"Getting a load of distortion from a pedal is usually hard to do without having it scream at you or simply rape your tone.And no pedal will ever sound as good as an amps distortion(well, a GOOD amps distortion).But this one is as clear as Ive heard yet.It will get compared to a boss metal zone because it has the same controls, but Ive never liked the sound of that pedal.They always sound tinny and just dont cut it with me.Take those controls, add a sharper and clearer sound, and youve got this pedal.The mid control knobs are what allow you to get a very large range of tone, so if you try this and dont like it, you probably just havent fiddled around with it enough.The only problems I have with this pedal is that it comes packaged in a plastic bubble like an action figure so you dont have anything to store it in, and the rubber pads on the bottom fall off easily.Ive lost two."
3,Lost it at the End...,"Simon does a good job with an interesting story. Even after having read the cases in law school, Simon gave me a new appreciation of the degree to which Marshall codified the Federalist vision...much to Jefferson's dismay.However, Simon's gratuitous slap at the Rehnquist Court and shallow partisan reference to Bush v. Gore left a bad taste. He did a great job covering the divisions between the Federalists and Jeffersonian Republicans and then botched it with a partisan digression into modern times. How unfortunate.Greg Patterson"
3,Its nice,"I read this book prior to purchasing and a liked the story so i bought the book, the seller was honest the book was used but in good condition, the pricing was reasonable and the book arrived before i expected which is a very good thing for me."
4,"Great Lyrics, upbeat tempo, and a fantastic introduction to Marcel","I ran across this song as a Promo cd for LTJ Bukem, one of the masters of drum and bass. Once I this track I became hooked! It's got a great pace and tempo. It's not D&B at ALL, which makes me wonder why it was released in association with that genre... Regardless, the lyrics are tight! Sena has main vocals and talks about a lover who is playing games and ""changing colours"" from the person she thought she was getting involved with. Great ""girl, what was I thinking?!"" song that married clever lyrics with a catchy beat, great instrumentation and a simple easy to remember message. Soft, spoken word style vocals, and a crisp band to back it up."
1,BIG MISTAKE!!,"I bought this CD because I love Latin music and wanted something to play to inspire me to exercise, and after reading the reviews, I thought i would try it. I now understand why you can't listen to this before buying, because it is terrible. The whole CD is this annoying repetitious sound (similar to Mexican Tuba music)and one number seem to flow into the next w/o much variation. Very disappointed!"
1,PIECE OF JUNK - DO NOT BUY,"I purchased this to help with the multitude of business cards I get through work each week.I set it up, started using it and, with all of the busines cards that I have run through it, it only reads a PARTIAL amount of the information. Name and maybe one number, no address etc.Tried to export to outlook, failed; imported from outlook, while that worked, I now get an error when I try to sync my blackberry with outlook.So i intend to remove it from my computer, what a waste of money.NOT A HAPPY PURCHASER !!!"
5,Not quite what you think,"I admit that I was a bit turned off by the possibility of a sappy environmental message. But if you are too, give it a moment. Most of the animated stories aimed at your kids involve ""evil villains"" and probably a decent amount of physical conflict. My daughter's at a stage where she is very sensitive to ""evil"" characters, so I decided to check the movie out. Yes, Leonard is right - nothing very memorable... for an adult. My 3-yr-old child saw this film a month ago and is still acting out scenes from it and making me play characters. And it's true that there is the sappy environmentalism of animals tut-tutting the way those humans act. But I'll give away a tiny surprise. The humans turn out to be not all bad."
2,Just one more cute 90's movie in the bin.,"I've always felt the worst movies are the ones that could have been good but weren't. I liked this movie when it first came out because I was 9 and I enjoyed forest animal movies with good music. This movie did all that but unfortunatly it managed to do all of this without a decent story. It's just not a good movie and it really could have been better if it had better story telling. Sorry, can't recomend it."
4,"Ah, childhood...",I loved this movie when I was a kid and re-watching it as an adult was and interesting experience. There's so much you don't catch when you're little. A great movie all around for kids and their parents.
1,"""enhanced"" - what's that? abominable quality?","This is the worst DVD I have ever seen. Not even Alpha Video would allow this! It's a fourth generation VHS-copy - at best! Beware, never buy from this company!Trying to read this picture is guesswork. The sound is however possible to make out - just about."
1,Adventures of Robin Hood: The Complete Second Season (2008),I bought the first season and was very disappointed. Video and sound quality were very poor. I won't be back for the second season.
2,Strawberry Shortcake: The Berryfest Princess,"My 2+ year old daughter didn't like this animated cartoon of Strawberry Shortcake as the characters looked different from the original cartoon series. She couldn't recognize Blueberry Muffin and insisted that wasn't her. Also, Pupcake has green polka in this animation, while its blue polka in the original. And they weren't many songs in this animated cartoon. I thought the songs were the main attraction for this cartoon. So, my daughter didn't find it interesting, rather boring with too much dialogue."
5,A very good analysis of the Western Theater strategy..,I re-read Woodworth's excellent treatise on Jefferson Davis and his involvement in the Western Theater. The chapters are succinct and focus more on strategy than in specific battle details. My favorite parts are the reviews at the end of each chapter. I have always believed that Lee's strategy to invade the North rather than deploying his forces in the West was a major blunder. If there is one salient point that screams from this book it is that Jeff Davis' personal relationships with his generals (Polk??) definitely was a detriment to his decision making. This book should be required reading for high school and undergraduate students. Indeed any leader could profit from the analysis and history rendered here.
4,A bit too stoneage?,"The name Bernard Cornwell attracts my attention immediately, but I was disappointed in my expectations here. The scene and the culture were less richly imagined than his Sharpe novels."
4,StoneHenge,"Mr. Cornwell did a great job getting you hooked in this tale about Stonehenge. What is good, you get historical data, but also it is woven so that you enjoy this data in a story. Great book!"
2,Mr. Cornwell falls a little short,"I absolutely love Mr. Cornwell's novels. Thomas of Hookton was an excellent character and I have found his adaptation of the King Arthur series incredible. However, I feel that Stonehenge is not as good as it could be. I had to literally trudge through the book. I expected something big or suprising to happen throughout the novel. The characters fell flat and the story was terrible. If you are a Cornwell fan, skip this one."
2,"I love Bernard Cornwell, but this was a slog","I have read many of the Sharpe novels, but this is nothing like it. I had to persist to get through this, rather than being swept away and enjoying the ride. It just didn't capture me."
2,A Surprising Disappointment,"I am quite familiar with Mr. Cornwell's work. From the Sharpes series to Saxon stories, I usually find his work intriguing and his characters brilliant and beautifully flawed. This is the exception.I'm not saying that every protagonist in a work of historical fiction should be a warrior or a hero, but they should have at least some redeemable quality other than being obedient. Saban, the protagonist, is about as complex as a Labrador who wags his tail when his family comes home from holiday.If you enjoy reading about cuckolded, cowardly, and weak men, then this is the book for you. I really had high hopes for this book, but after the first hundred or so pages, it ended up being Bob Villa's neolithic guide to stone masonry. Unsatisfying!"
3,Plodding and predictable,"I had read four of Cornwell's more recent books before picking up Stonehenge. It seems that he has improved greatly over time, because this earlier work is not up to the the level of his later efforts. The plot jerks along in fits and starts. The hero, Saban, has difficulty foreseeing what is obvious to any reader, and constantly gets into fixes that could easily have been avoided. Unless you are trying to complete your list of Cornwell books, avoid this and stick to his later works."
2,Bland,"A 470 page novel that feels like a 1000 page novel. The reader is overcome with paganism which, even the author seems not to care about."
1,Dreary ancient historical fiction from Mr. Cornwall.,"Did I really say that? I did, didn't I!I can hardly believe that Cornwall came out with this fanciful tale of the origins of Stonehenge. He really would have been better to have left this a mystery. I believe I only fought my way through the book because it is by Cornwall and I knew it must soon get better. Sadly it didn't.The plot is dreary, the narrative childish and simplistic, the setting is fanciful with a whole era in history (apparently), with it's own customs and religions, invented solely for this book. I consider the whole effort a sad waste of Mr. Cornwall's prodigious imagination and talent.I have read everything this chap has ever written and loved it all; I really do not know what he or, perhaps more importantly, his publishers were thinking about when they decided this project was good enough to go to print.Avoid this book unless you are looking for a cure for insomnia!"
4,Satisfied,"I bought this as a beefier replacement for my older power supply when I upgraded to a 8800 series graphics card.Not a whole lot to say about it- it works. The large single cooling fan seems to keep temperatures cool, while making relatively little noise. I've been running it in my new PC for about 4 months and haven't had any trouble yet. I'm sure there are fancier power supplies out there, but overall, I feel this was a good purchase."
1,USPS Delivery Smashed every item,"I gave it 1 star because I had to send back the first shipment, it was delivered by USPS with the dishes and glasses broken. So I returned it and the next shipment arrived and without even opening the box and you could hear pieces of glass just rattling inside. I had opened the shipping box on the first order and I thought it was packed ok. Amazon have been great on the returns, and if I had been home when the mailman dropped it off I would have refused shipment. I'm glad for the people who got their orders shipped without damage, but I guess USPS in Ohio doesn't care about it's customers."
4,a nice simple elegant set!,i got 2 sets of these because i love their simple straight forward look. and they'll go great with anything.very solid and performs very well. i am replacing all my crappy dishes with corelle and love it!i got this with the $20 off for 2 or more sets and that makes these even more worthwhile.
5,THE best........,"I purchased this as a children's book & accompanying cassette tape. My kids, now 25-32 absolutely LOVED LOVED it--- we would listen to it even on moderately short trips!! We cannot see or hear about a coyote without saying ""Im a caaaaaaayote & caaaayotes don't wear no clothes""!! Its like a familiar funny movie, where you know all the punch lines! I plan on buying the app for my grandkids---I still have the book set--and wish it was on DVD. I swear, its THE funniest re-telling of a tall tale ever. Robin Williams is at his finest!!"
4,Very good film,I chose this rating because its movie of 1990s cult classic and gave me triller experience to watch this movie.I liked it because it is suspense film.I would recommend this to customers to purchase from this seller.
3,A short story sadly expanded,"Rather than buy this book, find a copy of the short story ""Sir George and the Dragon"" by Weber; last seen in a Drake anthology ""Foreign Legions"". ""Excalibur Alternative"" is a modest fleshing out of that short. While adding a few more details, it is essentially unchanged from the short story and sadly proves the point that some stories work best as shorts.The only ""new"" concept here is in the final segment of the book, in which our hero and his lovely lady wife become Rulers of an Interstellar Kingdom. Can anyone say ""proto-Manticore?""In my opinion, this Harrington background/mythology creation is interesting but not interesting enough to justify an entire book. However, if you haven't read the most excellent short story and keep in mind that this tale was never supposed to be a novel, then your money would not be wasted. If, on the other hand, like me you already have ""Sir George and the Dragon"", then there's little sense in buying it twice."
2,i DIDN'T LIKE IT,Boring and a weak story. maybe put this in the teen-age section. I wasted my money. I would be happywith a credit to my account.
3,Older Nora Roberts not up to her current work,I love Nora Roberts. I bought this thining it was newer (my mistake). Just not up to what she writes now. I gave it three stars for people who haven't read her before and maybe they'd find it ok. VERY easy read which is nice sometimes but these characters just weren't as well rounded as her characters are now.
2,not happy with used book.,I selected a used book and unfortunately it is quite worn and the pages are discolored..I've always been pleased with used purchases. Maybe this is an exception..
4,enjoy the romance,Always enjoy books by Nora Roberts. Have never read one that I did not like. The intrigue combined with the romance is always a pleasure.
3,First Impressions,Disappointed with this book. Unrealistic in that things happened too fast. It was as though it was written in 15 minutes just to make money.
3,Only for a long trip,"The First Horseman does have some very interesting points, facts, and theories but I would only suggest this book to someone that is on a long trip with nothing else to do. The book is clogged up with very pointless bits that have nothing to do with the story. If these were taken out you could probably take a whole 50 pages off the book. The author does have a nice style of writing though, which is pleasant but doesn't keep you interested. I personally would like a book that keeps me wondering what is going to happen next all the time. This book barley ever did this for me. But if you're looking for an interesting view on biological warfare this is a good book to read."
3,Not in a league with The Genesis Code,"Like many of you, I read and truly enjoyed Case's ""The Genesis Code"". Case's writing style is captivating and yields a ""fun"" read. But, (always a but...) this second outing was somewhat disjointed and meandering. First, we're in North Korea (with a character that is never seen again), then in Washington with the ""sure fire"" ring of covert government officials (again, most of whom never continue on), then in Russia... I would have liked to see a more coherent plot development, and less ""pin ball"" from Case."
3,Good Holiday Fare,"This book is about a journalist's quest against the FBI, CIA, Army, a religous cult and various scientists to uncover the truth about a dastardly plan to mutate a flu virus into a the mother of all biological weapons.As is all too often the case, the author has picked a subject in which he is obviously well read and has woven a rather elaborate plot to showcase his knowledge. As with many of his contemporaries, this book has the feel of a film script without the dialog. You find yourself imagining action scenes which the author scarcely describes. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing - I read this book on holidays and found it light, entertaining, and page turning; I even learnt one of two things.Overall, it is passable fare - plotwise it is almost instantly forgettable but entertaining nonetheless."
2,"fast-paced, highly forgettable","This book is like a disposable razor. It works for a while, but you can casually throw it out when you're done. My main gripe is that the characters are relentlessly boneheaded. Friend gets death threats and then mysteriously disappears? OH, HE'S PROBABLY OUTTA TOWN! Why doesn't the press report this vital story? 'CAUSE THE FBI SENT ALL NEWSPAPER EDITORS A NASTY FAX! Why does the main character try to free his girlfriend from the cult compound *alone*? HEY, THE FBI SCREWED UP HOSTAGE SITUATIONS AT WACO AND RUBY RIDGE, DIDN'T THEY?! Why doesn't the main character report the whole story in the end? 'CAUSE FREE SPEECH IS OVERRIDDEN BY THIS NATIONAL EMERGENCY (according to a ficticious article of the constitution). Good book for a plane flight, maybe, but that's it."
3,Small heater,"This heater is very small, would be perfect if you wanted to raise a small room a few degrees. Running on it's highest settings it does blow heat but nothing too impressive. They try to throw you off with the 5,200 BTU advertising statement. Good item but again only buy if you are trying to slightly warm up a small room."
5,A Guidebook Like No Other!!,"Eldercare For Dummies is truly my companion. It covers all the things I've been thinking about and addresses issues I never thought about. Its comprehensive nature allows me to have an imperative resource at my fingertips. I actually feel more at ease having this book in my home. Before the book, I was perusing and storing many articles, publications, info centers. I never had complete clarity in one place at one time. It definitely adds ease to my life!"
3,Hidden power of the 12th house,"This is a book to interprete many aspects of the 12th house. With several examples, the author describes how unconscious world is related to the issues descended from generation to generation and hidden talents that have not been cultivated by the ancestors. Since todayfs world is hustling and bustling, we often neglect the unproductive world of the 12th house. But if we set up favorable conditions to give insights into understanding our hidden power, the 12th house can provide us with plenty of potential resources and contentment that are lacking in our daily lives. I hope that this book will give you some indication of how to be familiar with such aspects of the 12th house and conduct conscious work to cultivate it."
2,Repetitive and Dated,"In it's day it would have been a life altering read for anyone with short term memory loss. The advice is basic if not slightly geared toward ED/ANA. It is possible that I am a generation too young for this to rock my world. Vaseline on teeth, tape on clothes, silly old school model advice, etc.I gave it two because my mother was impressed. I'm 30 and not."
2,Nothing Great Here,"I have found very few helpful tips in this book, most I've already heard of. Some of it sounds like it was written by a square non-sexy old woman. Advises: Don't try to look younger? Never wear fishnet hose? no short miniskirts or jogging outfits when your not jogging? no babydoll dresses after high school? what?? and hey i like my dirty sneakers & torn jeans. and i LOVE my transparant clothing.. and im WAY out of high school! the beauty & diet tips may help if you're from planet Jupiter and have just landed on earth with no clue. however i think even some cave-men did what she recommends!!"
4,A Southern Belle,"The characters were a hoot, and quite memorable. The story line did get a little redundant and dragged some, but all in all the book was really good. I look forward to the authors' additional books."
2,This is not the 1944 production with Bob Hope,While my kids loved it; the movie is very fanciful; it does not compare to the 1944 production of the same title that starred Bob Hope and Virginia Mayo!
3,Uneven Album but Some Gems,"""Do What You Do"", an introspective ballad, and the fast moving, dance floor ""Dynamite"" and ""Sweetest Sweetest"" are three very pleasant and enjoyable songs.I would probably recommend one of the albums by the Jacksons that came out about that same time, Torture or Victory, over this one."
1,"Oh, Mother song","I don't have a review, I just want to know if this CD contains the song ""Oh, Mother."""
5,An insight of a gardener,"When I received this book, I couldn't put it down. I read it all in one day. So interesting, Her sensitivity is really amazing."
2,"Not worth the money, plus too much vulgar language.","I have two major complaints about this book. First, it is only mildly entertaining. Second, Kaplan uses way too much vulgarity and cynicism."
2,"I opened this book, and a pea rolled out.","Make no mistake, I am a staunch_fan of pud's work. Nevertheless I must protest the complete lack of kiwi pictures and contributions from techstocktony. Where are the borderline insane insights from Cheopys and the inevitable flames from Uncle Meat?Two severed thumbs down."
5,Finally some sanity!,"As expected, Kaplan's approach to the venture capital-induced madness that subsumed the 'internet industry' is the same hilariously straightforward cynical analysis that gave his website instant cult status. I couldn't put the book down and laughed out loud at least once every two pages.A work of literature it is not, but if you have any interest in the 'internet bubble' and always suspected that the whole thing a massive joke, then this is a definite must-read."
1,Agressively Unfunny,"Those idiotic dot coms and the Internet bubble as a whole cannot be mocked enough for me but Kaplan really tried my patience with this throwaway book. He is agressively unfunny and seemed more interested in detailing his masterbatory habits to his readers than giving them any kind of information on the companies that he is ""profiling.""His is an adolescent mind and the book was apparently written for a target audience of 9th graders."
5,Proof there is a god,"Ain't it cool how Pud is still in business, and most of his detractors are hoping you'll supersize that Big Mac without making them beg for the upgrade? In addition to being hilarious, this masterful tome reinforces the single most important lesson of the Intermess: porn works (maybe that's why everyone went bust, nyuck nyuck nyuck). Can't wait for the TV show, dude."
3,Good Information but the presentation is F'd,"Mr. Kaplan provides an informative array of thumbnail corporate (principally e-commerce, i.e., dot bomb) obituaries spanning approximately a two-year period, where, if you weren't too busy during that same time period trying to successfully short your stocks, get additional funding for your own corporation, or simply staring at a pink slip, you may recognize a handful of the enterprises ""profiled.""I use the term profiled loosely here because I found Mr. Kaplan's attempt at providing value added editorial comment to the few facts or ancillary information about these entities previously provided by those in the know to Mr. Kaplan's website to be highly distracting and on the whole useless.This material is a quick read and if reformatted with the extraneous commentary and distracting vulgarity redacted, it would comprise a pamphlet that could be read well within an hour (or, as an homage to Mr. Kaplan, within four trips to the bathroom)."
1,Hunter Thompsons Cabana Boy writes a book,"A lazy mans Journey through the elephants graveyard of Dot-bombs, guided by an annoying self promoting New Yorker. Old news ho hum......"
2,Capitolizing .com failures,"...His writing is absolutely terrible and it is quite obvious the the publisher printed this book to cash in on Kaplan's sudo Internet fame. However, the underlying theme of the book (if you can deal with the crudeness) is actually somewhat interesting. Its just too bad someone like Kaplan had to do this and not a credible author."
2,"If You've Read The Web Site, Don't Bother","If you have been to the web site that spawned this book, you've had access to all this book has to offer. There is no new insight, no new research, no significant details about any of the companies listed, and apparently nobody felt the need to clean up any of the prose. If you are expecting any sort of analysis of any of the companies, you won't find it here. This book is purely anecdotal.Still, that said, bits of this book can be humorous. I couldn't read it straight through, but you can pick it up at any page and find yet another story of somebody who thought banner ads would fund their silly idea."
5,Too cute!,It's a very adorable bear we haven't hooked him up and played the sounds yet but so far so good. There was initially an issue with with the first item shipped but the seller resolved the issue quickly. Thanks!
2,Great Baby Gift,"The womb sound quickly soothes the baby to allow him to go to sleep. You can place the bear anywhere in the crib because the sound is loud enough. I also feel it is safe to have in the crib because the bear lays flat and won't tip over onto the baby if placed close. My nephew loves the silkie trim on the blanket, he'll hold onto it until he falls asleep. I highly recommend this gift to anyone, whether your baby is fussy or not."
2,not impressed,I was really excited until I opened it. Small and not exactly the sound quality I thought it would have. We're returning it.
3,Auto-on feature is not consistent,"I think you can get by with a regular teddy bear and a CD of womb sounds. The noise turns on intermittently. I close the door too loudly, the sound will turn on, but when the baby cries, it doesn't. Also, the battery seems to have a short life."
4,Works Great,"The bear works well, but I wish the sound would go for a longer period of time. It only plays for 5 minutes, which isn't enough to get my little one to sleep."
3,Lionheart Bear,"I think the idea of this bear is wonderful but having said that, I do believe it needs to be introduced to a baby when they are a newborn and used from that time on for it to be effective. I started using the bear when my daughter was about 3 and a half to 4 mths old and it did nothing to calm her down. If anything it was probably annoying. It was just another noise to her but maybe she would have been more accepting of it had she heard the noise constantly from a newborn stage.We don't use it anymore, its pointless as it has no effect on her and then my partner and I have to listen to it which is quite annoying."
3,"Cute Idea, But needs work","The slumber bear looks cute and will hopefully turn into a favorite toy of my daughter's. However, as far as comforting my daughter, the bear only works if she goes back to sleep within the five minute period. I have seen her calm down a bit when the sound kicks on, however, the minute the sound shuts off, my daughter is up and fussing. The sound activator is not sensitive enough. The only time the sound has started on its own is when I've squeezed the bear or dropped it. I spent the first couple of weeks getting up and squeezing the bear when it shut off. After two weeks, I gave up. The company either needs to make a device in which the sound lasts longer or design some type of remote control for the parents."
5,Like Two Friends Talking,"I loved this book. It was so funny that I would stop and call my sister up. She yelled at me because I was telling her all the good stuff. I loaned this book out to every Tom, Dick and Harry. They all loved it and they were from all walks of life. This book is for everyone. It has helped me more than Ronan will ever know. I read it about 5 times already. I find myself picking it up on a bad day or when things are not the greatest. Each time I read it, its like we are two good friends sitting down and telling stories. His stories are much better than mine!!"
5,joyful indeed,"i love trying new/independant/underground artists, because it provides a safe adventure. this cd is definitely a treasure. it blends and contorts a variety of genres and styles of music to delight a myriad of listening pleasures. i can comfortably sit and just listen...and be transported anywhere i want to go by this music. purchase and enjoy."
5,A Breath of Fresh Air for the music business,I found Ayo on a social music site and I swear she has a gorgeous voice but the lyrics are amazing too. This album you can listen to from start to finish. I have given it to my girlfriend and she loves it too.
5,excellent for large openings,"This gate is used to contain 2 golden retrievers, and has been doing a great job. Easy to install, sturdy, and great for large opening between two rooms."
4,Corelle Impressions,"My wife and I have been looking for a set of Corelle dishes for some time. We made the mistake of buying stoneware sets in the past because I liked the heft, but later found that they do not hold up well to the daily use; after only three years they began to break.This set of dishes is much stronger and lighter, but hold up well to the daily use we give them. We bought two sets and they only take half the space of the stoneware set they replaced. They are plain, but the design on the edge makes them nice enough to use over the holidays.I gave it only a ""4"" because I am still adjusting to the dishes being so lightweight which in reality is a good thing.There are also other dishes available to this set so it can be exxpanded upon. We are pleased with this purchse."
4,Burton's strong fusion roots,"Gary Burton provides here a fine example of his strong foundation in fusion. He is often overlooked as being a founder of fusion, but this album shows that he was one of the very first to experiment with rock/jazz music. The disc starts off with the intense, rollicking vibrafinger. Burton utilizes the rare electrovibes that were manufactured in small numbers about 35 years ago. The furious melodic and harmonic interplay between the brilliant Burton and the steadfast studio musicians is unparalelled in the field of vibraphone induced fusion. Burton goes on to cover ""pain in my heart,"" the song that was popularized by Otis Redding, as well as ""I never loved a man"" by Aretha Franklin. Burton utilizes the entire sonic and dynamic range of the vibraphone which he helped design. His four mallet technique has yet to be surpassed. This cd is a fine example of Fusion and Gary Burton's mastery of the jazz vibraphone."
4,What a freak!,"Jim Cramer...wow, what a freak job. Fortunately, I enjoy freaks...people who dont let times define them and try to define the times. This guy is hyper type A and he lets it hang out in this auto-biography. I did get the impression sometimes that he was making some passive apologies and not telling the whole story or softening his role in one controversy or another but I cant say for sure. I read the book, enjoyed it, will read his others...and yes, I even learned a few things about investing."
2,Arguing for the sake of arguing,"O'Leary made an honest effort to provide insights into the mechanics of apocalyptic reasoning. Moving from definitions of apocalypse and rhetoric, O'Leary extracted three basic topoi: time, evil, and authority. By means of a case study of the Millerites and Hal Lindsey's writings, O'Leary gave the three topoi a home in the tactics of persuasion of Miller and Lindsey. Though the subject matter is a timely one, the book does not appear accessible to everyone. This scholarly written book includes intense philosophical and literary discussions and presumes one to be acquainted with rhetoric. However, for the scholar who can follow the flow of the argument the application seems rather trite. Yet for the layperson the application seems of utter interest but the discussion of methodology and the foundational presentation of apocalyptic reasoning seems beyond grasp."
5,The Best Epic Fantasy Author since J.R.R. Tolkien,"Yet again, Goodkind kind amazes this reader with his limitless imagination. His use of multiple character storylines keeps you reading until ridiculous hours of the night. Now that I'm done, I can finally get a good nights sleep. I find myself checking the internet on a weekly basis just to see when the next book is going to be released."
4,"Not as addictive as first two books, but good none the less.","This book was good but not great. It is however part of one of the best series around. Goodkind is extremely adept at introducing new characters in each of his novels and continually developing minor characters into more meomorable characters. He also deserves kudos for his descriptions of battles and their aftermaths. The attention to detail is what has made reading this whole series enjoyable. The only criticizms I have of Temple of the Winds is that most of the plot seems contrived. Compared to the other books in this series, Temple is rather predictable. Hopefully Goodkind will write another novel in this series and increase the suspense a little. Overall this book continues the series nicely, but leaves a lot to be desired."
4,"A good book, but not on the level of the previous ones","I was disappointed with this one. I mean, don't get me wrong; I was good, and i enjoyed it, but like I said, it just didn't live up to Wizard's First Rule and Stone of Tears. It was, however, several orders of magnitude better than Blood of the Fold. The only reason to read Blood of the Fold is so that you're not lost when you pick up Temple of the Winds. The series as a whole, though, is incredible. Okay, so the fact that Richard is Darken Rahl's son is cliche, (imagine Rahl saying, in a low, breathy voice, ""Richard... I am your father. Come over to the dark side) but overall, it's good. Even though the plot devices are a bit banal, the writing has been impecable throughout, even in Blood of the Fold. So, what I'm trying to say here is, read this series, but don't rate it on a book-by-book basis. You'll be much more satisfied that way."
1,"Awful. Really, really bad","I read the first three books and enjoyed them; this is barely readable.A few new characters are done well (Cara), most are horrible (Nadine). And while I'm not opposed to love and romance (I've read my share of trashy romances) the never-ending sap-fest between Kahlan and Richard is tiresome. If their love is so true and great, why all the jealousy and need for constant reassurance? They carry on like a couple of whiny, insecure teenagers.I understand the need to revisit some of the previous novels but there's way too much of it and it's accomplished badly; incessant questioning and detailed explanations and history lessons while in pursuit of a deadly enemy? Seriously? That's just one example. Several plot devices were absurd and hard to buy into and I found myself thinking they (the characters) were often behaving stupidly.I had been looking forward to reading this series, but if the following books are similar to this one, this will be my last. Hugely disappointing."
2,Nothing spectacular,"I really love the series, but I find that his writing is very corny. The characters show absolutely no developement. I dislike the quick solutions that the heroes always seem to find. I find Terry Goodkind lacks originality in his writing. Hopefully in his later books Goodkind can display better character developement, a better plot. I hope so for his sake, because if he doesn't, the series will lose its popularity."
4,Rather Good What?,"Jolly Good show old boy. I would have to say that the murderer Drefan Rahl's character was good at the end but his sexual violence was pointless to a certain extent. Kahlan betraying Richard wasn't what the audience wanted though, even to get into that magical temple. Still, good book, read worse, not a patch on tolkien though, sorry. Oh More Nathan please he's the best character."
3,"Not bad, but not up to the standard of the previous 3 books","This is an enjoyable book, but sadly does not come up to the standards set in ""Wizards first Rule"", ""Stone of Tears"" and ""Blood of the Fold"". The suspense that was created in those books was just not there in this one. ""Soul of the Fire"" and ""Faith of the Fallen"" are out, but I was not left with the feeling that now I've finished this one I must read the next one.Saying that though, I will read the next book in the series because although I was disappointed with this book I still have faith in Terry Goodkind. Temple of the Winds is not bad, just not as good as his previous work."
3,"good, but reader has problems","I love the book series, the one problem with the audio book is the reader pronounces Katlin as Karlen. Its really anoying. It sounds almost like a guys name."
1,"If I hate it so much, why do I keep reading?","Another typical installment in The Sword of Truth series. I get done with each book wondering why I even bothered to finish it, but then for some reason read the next installment. Very poor character development. Richard is the only one I can stand. Anyone who didn't see that Drefan was going to be the killer was asleep at the wheel. Does anyone else have a tough time picturing this world? I can never seem to get a clear picture of anything. I do see similarities to Robert Jordan, but Jordan uses these motifs masterfully while Goodkind just throws them in whether they fit or not. I should give this book 2 stars if only for the fact that I actually made it to the fourth book in the series. In conclusion, I'll probably still read the next book"
5,Great,"Temple of the Winds (Sword of Truth, Book 4)Have all the books in the series great storytelling. Terry Goodkind almost makes you believe it could be true."
3,Decent,The first was excellent and it has gone downhill since. The same as the wheel of time series.
3,Bad,"Frankly this book was horrible, Richard and Kahlan were boring and the price to get into the Temple of the Winds was stupid. Their story was all about how much they loved each other. If it wasn't that I liked Zedd and Ann I would give this book one star. I hope Goodkind gets better in book 5, because Book 1 was good and Book 2 was alright but from Book 3 on it is only getting worse"
2,"By the fourth book, Goodkind's writing style becomes really annoying.","I'll give Terry Goodkind credit for a having a decent imagination, but he has a serious problem: He distributes dialogue like a 5 year-old with A.D.D. The characters constantly have long, repetitive, melodramatic, unnecessary conversations at the most ludicrous moments imaginable. Even though the entire world is in peril and there's precious little time to save it, the characters will simply drop what they're doing and talk and talk and TALK, even in the middle of an action sequence. All this talking makes the story seem totally unrealistic. This is a very unsatisfying read that will have you rolling your eyes over and over."
4,GREAT READ!!,"Another slain dragon for Mr. Goodkind! While maybe not as good as the others, it was still above the level of most writers. And for those who try to compare Mr. Goodkind to Mr Jordan(Robert, not Micheal), I have this to say: Mr Goodkind is publishing books."
3,didn't care for it,"It's an OK collection, but just some more remixes of stuff already included on countless other disks. Save your money."
1,Unbelievably dumb marketing by Bravo,"A fantastic show? Yes. But as others have noted, what in the world is the point to releasing THREE of NINE episodes (counting the double-length pilot as one episode)? Not only is it one-third of the total that rabid fans want, but it's actually episodes 1, 5, and 6 instead of 1, 2, and 3! Is it any wonder consumers are so angry at the studios over how they release their content? If you buy this consider yourself warned. This disc is nothing but a tease. If you insist on being frustrated just rent it from Netflix. That way every time you see the disc one your shelf you won't feel like an idiot for having bought it knowing that you're getting a small hodgepodge of a great show.The show may be ""Brilliant but Cancelled,"" but Bravo is ""Wrong-headed and Absurd."""
1,not for open back amps,"I bought the stand before my amp arrived in the mail. The stand iswell made and all, but my Fender Mark IV amp is an open backand the stands upper arms do not rest against anything( hence open back ) and the amp tilts WAY back where thearms are almost resting on the speakers themselves.I threw out the box, and cannot not return it now, soI used a piece of wood across the back to the amp tohave it sit better, but now my fender dust cover wontgo on. Oh well, live and learn."
5,"A magnificent talent, both as songwriter and singer.","It was no accident that Barbara captured the heart of France. Her lyrics were poetic, yet with that political/social edge one would expect of a woman who knew the struggles of war and racism."
5,Expands Waiste...does the job,"This gives you an extra inch in the waisteband. I have 3 of them, and none have broken yet. It seems I cant find a true fit anymore and when something is cut small this helps. Of course, that ice cream after dinner isn't helping the situation."
1,Very Uncomfortable,I purchased these for my husband and he hates them. They are not made like the older style where the eyelet was made of stretchy bands. These are all hard plastic which rub against the skin.
4,good gift,"My husband and I researched a lot of marriage/love books to read together while dating/engaged. This is one we went through and really liked. It's not as in-depth as some other ones, but provides good discussion starters. This book is designed in a very nice format for gift-giving."
2,THIS BOOK IS SOOOO OUT OF DATE!,"The information is this book is totally out of date and is approaching uselessness at this point. Try the Vault.com Guide to the Top Law Firms, or check out the Vault.com site, where all the law firms profiles are updated in real time."
3,"Good, but a little out-of-date","A lot of the information in this book seems out of date. I thought the Vault Reports Guide to America's Top 50 Law Firms, from VaultReports, was more current and had more information on each firm. But the Insider's Guide is still worth reading."
2,It's OK,"This book has a lot of really cute ideas, but I found many of them impractical. I bought the book thinking I could use the activities in my classroom, however, as another commenter mentioned, many of the ideas call for some obscure supplies and can get expensive. Additionally, many of the ideas are better for the 9 year olds than the 3 year olds."
1,Someone lives in their own private Idaho.,"Dude, I really don't know waht phaggot made me read this piece of junk. I think I have to write this review for class credit or something. Anyways, I read somewhere on the internet that prior to 132 B.C. Idaho was ruled by spiders. I don't know why that Morris guy couldn't have written about that.Instead he writes about precarious normalcy or something. Some athletes and their dads. It looks like he was trying to get this turning into some ghey movie starring James Van Der Beek. Instead it just makes me hate Idaho. There is also some story about a man going blind from masturbation. I think this author's writing is pretty masturbatory itself.I was really disappointed in the story ""Astronauts."" No one went to the moon, but the author did bend over and show us that he is an arse. So I guess there is that."
5,Very warm and cozy,This looks great and is very thick and warm for those cold wintery days. If you want it to fit better order one size down.
4,warm,"The jacket arrived in a timely manner. I was disapponted in the fit as I wanted it to be a liitle larger....should have ordered one size bigger. It seeems to be a good, quality item & warm I'm sure."
2,Sent wrong size!,"I ordered this columbia fleece in a size small. I received it today and it was a medium. The tag on the inside of the jacket says medium, and the sticker on the bag it was packaged it said medium, but the price tag said it was a small. The jacket is way too big for me, and I would like to return it. I am hesitant though, because I'm worried that if I return it and order from this seller again I will receive another jacket in the wrong size. Has anyone else had this problem?"
4,Columbia Fleece,"Love this fleece. It is light weight but warm. It is easy care fabric. Because it is not real expensive I can toss it in the back seat of my car and off I go. If I need it..great. I have two of them, black and navy. I want more. Will be ordering more."
3,No Support for Linux,"The Encylopedia Britannica is definitely a ""five star"" reference source. However, they no longer support Linux and I have to use vmware to use it. Therefore I award only three stars."
1,Slouching Towards Psychobabble,"Alternate title: Overstating the Obvious. Has this woman been living in this country the past few years? What a hack job! I have to confess, I did not finish the book, as I could not stomach it any longer. These visions of the annointed (sorry Thomas Sowell) are both predictable and pathetic. Don't waste your time with this swill. If you want the real scoop, spend some time with Mr. Sowell."
4,Convoluted storyline,"Sixty year old Booth Stallings is an expert on terrorism who has been employed by the US government for many years, so when he is suddenly sacked, he is at a loss to understand exactly why this has happened, not for one moment believing the flim flam that's been fed to him. He is approached by an intermediary to recruit a few helpers to make an offer to a Filipino rebel leader to retire to Hong Kong with a payout of US$5,000,000, as he and this rebel had worked together during WW2. He gathers a team of expert con men, including one woman, to help in the elaborate caper which takes place on the island of Cebu in the Philippines. The plot and counter plots are so convoluted that the reader must keep his or her wits about them as people change sides, pretend to change sides, and are involved in very shadowy deals. It's a good read for lovers of involved spy deals."
4,Does the job great!,"I bought these to replace the mids in a set studio style speakers I have they fit great and sound better then the old ones alot better in fact, they also handle alot of volume and for the money you can't beat'em"
1,This book is outdated by 4 years.,This book references hotbot and lycos. It is completely in need of being updated for 2006. Google is only mentioned in passing as an alternative search engine for marketing insurance on the internet. Please save your money.
3,Perhaps helpful a little dated.,Maybe it is the extensive coverage or the fact that this is practically technical but it seems to be a little out of date. Yet it is not a collection of volunteer mainatined Internet FAQ's which is good. It is an original work and was very helpful in some aspects of helping my friends connect to the net.
2,Not a Bb Clarinet,"I bought this for my daughter who has an allergy to Nickel- which most clarinets have in the keys under the silver. This one is supposed to have brass under the silver. I did not let her use this one until a few days before a concert she was having because I wanted the silver keys to be pretty. Well it is a Ab clarinet, not a Bb clarinet. The barrel is too short. I sent the barrel back to the company that shipped it and am waiting for the correct part to ship back to me. My daughter borrowed a barrel and is using the clarinet, so all else works and she is happy with it."
3,Good,"These are a gift for my mom, just got them yesterday. Looks like a choker pearl necklace, so I'm a bit worried she won't like them. I figured they would hang a bit lower on the neckline. Probably, my fault since I know very little about necklace lengths. I do like the size of pearls though."
4,Great Pearls for the price,"I bought these pearls for my wife to wear on our wedding day. She loved them and they (and her) looked stunning. The pearls are very closely uniformed and half only very mild (only detectable from inches away) blemishes. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that the knotting in the silk was so tight it came out of the box quite kinked. No worries, it straightened right out with a little exercise. All in all a great product!"
4,Kilgore Trout goes to Lake Wobegon!,"A wonderful romp through the fading memoirs of a mensch in renaissance man's clothing. Offering the local color of a Garrison Keillor coupled with the wry wit and humanism of Kurt Vonegut, Richler's quasi autobiographical novel entertains and enriches. While you don't have to be a montreal jew to appreciate his writing - it sure doesn't hurt!"
4,"Not a likeable character, but quite an enjoyable read!","I don't think anyone will ""like"" Barney when they've read this book - he's amoral, hypocritical, sleazy, unrepentant, and sneaky. However, the story of his life is interesting and can teach us lessons about our own lives. The literary references are rampant throughout the book, bordering on ""inside joke"" style. If you can get beyond that, and also follow Barney's scatter-brained style of jumping from past to present, you will get something out of this book."
5,Great Buy!,"I love this drive. Looks nice. Works great. And I like the plug and play function between Windows and Mac computers. The Silverlining program is great for working with any Win98 friends (yes, they're still around).The only CON is a rather superficial one. I thought from the picture (and Porche name) that the drive's casing would be a silver plating... or aluminum or something shiny and fancy. It's only made of plastic... shiny plastic. HAHA! But I overlooked this when faced with the ease of use it presented. So overall it's a great buy. NO REGRETS with this purchase."
3,JUST THE FACTS MA'AM,"Just a hodge-podge of early television and character development. I liked the music and drama, and knowing that many of the stories were taken from real-life events in Los Angeles. In the series that I bought, Joe Friday's partner was Ben Alexander known as Officer Frank Smith, and Frank was right there playing second fiddle and feeding the lines to the boss. Their hats and thin ties were right on, and so was Joe's clipped discussions. The series hasn't stood the test of time too well, but it was fun to revisit the old tv shows..and of course, my childhood early TV days."
1,Beginner's handbook,Barely scratches the surface of the content implied by the title. This book contains far too much introductory material aimed at an audience of neophytes. A great deal of the practical information in the book can be obtained gratis from the application notes available from the manufacturer. A real dissappointment.
1,Blech!,"This is not at all what I'd expected. I'd thought it would be some sort of 70s-era back-to-the-land resource. Instead it's a scatterbrained socialist manifesto (the dedication is to 'Uncle Ho,' i.e. the murderous Ho Chi Ming). Not worth buying or reading, really, expect as a glimpse into a thankfully now-past era."
5,Wonderful set - perfect for starting out,"I got this set as a gift from the in-laws after I got married - that was 6 years ago. So far the set looks like new though we use the plates and glasses everyday.We did purchase four more plates, cereal bowls and glasses our of necessity. I also have the cassarole dishes, stoneware bowls, salt and pepper shaker, spoon rest, tea kettle, cannister set, cookie jar, baking pans, dinner platter and the larger bowls. Oh and I almost forgot I also have the ramekins too as well as the sugar bowl, creamer, hot plate, stove burner covers and napkin holder. This design is simple yet attractive and the quality of the dishes is very good. My mother still has a set of corelle dishes from about 20 years ago and they are still in great shape.This pattern is getting harder to find (believe me I would know) so if you are lookng for a motif for your kitchen and this catches you eye get it you won't be sorry!"
5,Callaway Accesories,"I love all of the Corelle Callaway pieces..my only problem is that I can't seem to find the matching Callaway knives, forks and spoons. Can anyone help??"
3,Desk-sized Spine,"Bought this as a study tool for class, and as a student did not have much to spend on it. It does the trick of allowing me to study most of the large structures of the spine, however it does have some issues. The spinal nerves are not in place well and tend to fall out randomly, the spine is not able to hold its curves, although it is flexible, it will not stay when you bend it, important features that I need to know are not even on the vertebra. So, all in all, it was cheap and allows me to study most things, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, or purchase it again."
1,avoid at all costs,"I received this as a gift, and very soon the list of grievances grew very long. Of the various digital cameras I've used (about 10 different kinds), it is the worst in terms of features and performance. Some notable flaws:1) flash recharging time between photos is unacceptable (in view of several other cameras I've used)2) in about 90% of the photos I took there was egregiously noticeable over-exposure or under-exposure (i.e., way too bright or way too dark, so that I couldn't see the objects well).3) the settings mode falls way short of what other cameras offer (e.g., background light mode for flash)4) no optical viewer, i.e., only LCD, which eats up the battery very quickly"
4,Comes In Handy !,"All In One was the first book I used in my first writer's class in college. It clarifies all the little grammar, issues. Not for the average American, more like for ESL students. But it does good to anyone with slight writing, spelling, etc, problems."
3,Great book for beginners,"This was the first origami book I received from my parents. I was about 10 years old at the time, and I spent most of the following year reproducing the various models contained therein. It was probably the best introduction I had to origami.That said, however, I would recommend this book solely for beginners. Many (if not most) of the more complex models are constructed from two different ""bases"" and glued together creating the final product. Others (such as the shrimp) entail cutting various pieces of the paper to illicit the final model.For purists (such as myself), this is unacceptable for any intermediate (or above) origami. Separate pieces of paper for different _aspects_ of a model (e.g. a horse and a rider) are acceptable, in my opinion. This book, however, goes one step further in using separate pieces of paper for a single, atomic model."
1,Never received World of Origami book,"First of all, I never received this book as requested and paid for. This has been a poor service; and I would like a refund! The least your service could do is provide a new copy of the book via Fed-Ex/next day air. This has been, totally, irresponsible and I would like to be reimbursed for this!"
3,less than expected,merchandise arrived after a week and a half of waiting; cover is a little worn; pages in fair condition.shipping and handling could a be a little prompter.king watcher
4,buckle up for a wild ride,"I haven't seen the DVD (which from what I've read is good). I do own the un-cut French language version on VHS. Its nice to see that an action adventure movie can be made without extreme violence or predictable ""Die Hard"" style plots. ""Subway"" is a dazzling, exciting, and funny look at the Metro's underworld of eccentric characters. Great cast featuring Christophe Lambert as the likable safecracker and Jean-Hughes Anglade as the misfit skater. But its Isabelle Adjani who steals the show - her scene at the formal dinner table is funnier than Bruce Willis could ever hope to be."
1,Who said Subway ?,"Thanks to Luc Besson and UAV Entertainment (Luc, did you sell your soul with that great movie's copyrights ?) not to include the original soundtrack on a DVD featuring a french movie that is not even out in France ! The images look like they've been stone-washed in some italian wash-machine... Shame on you Luc ! They're not that good at ""entertainment""..."
1,If you purchase this you'll regret it.....,"I purchased Subway because I've become a big Luc Besson fan after watching several of his films: ie.Fifth Element,The Professional, Wasabi,etc.,: all very good films. In addition to the connection to Luc Besson there were a number of favorable reviews posted to this site. After having watched Subway I can't imagine someone giving it a favorable review; and I watched the supposedly ""best version"" of the film. There was no aspect of the film that made it worth spending time watching it. Til you've seen the movie, you're simply choosing which reviews to believe. I'm telling you, if you purchase this you'll regret spending time and money on it. If there were a rating lower than one star, I would have selected that."
4,Read this.,"McCall is Ridley Pearson, great read, great story, get this one and start reading this accomplished author, so get started."
4,Works Great and almost fit,"I bought this for use on my Craftsman table saw and am quite pleased. I would have given it a 5 except for the cheesy depth guage and end squaring bracket. The miter bar didn't fit my slots, off by .002"" so I honed it a bit and now fits nicer than anything else I have. Took about 20 minutes to remove the earwax, hone the bar, move it to the alternate mounting for left tilt and square it all up. A few well placed wacks to squre it with the blade and now measures less than .001"" runout across the table. Mounted a slab of UHMW with the provided holes and ran some test cuts, perfect! I still chuckle when I see the cuts the Forrest blade makes, ready for wax :)All in all I'm quite pelased with it, the accuracy, repeatability and ease of use, not something I often find in woodworking tools."
1,Wondering about Delta,"I bought the Delta 34-183 Tenoning Jig and, while trying to adjust to left tilt saw, rounded an allen screw because they must have assembled it with an impact wrench. I took it back and exchanged it today, brought another one home, removed all the goo again, and the first screw I tried was ALREADY ROUNDED out in a factory sealed box. I'm getting my money back. Other companies make them too."
2,Delta 34-83 NOT a Universal jig,"I've just been informed by an ebay lister that this model Delta 34-183 is not a universal jig:""Delta type saws where the blade axis is 4 1/4"" to 4 3/8"" from the inside of the left miter slot. If your saw varies (like a Powermatic 66) significantly from this, you should consider another jig or that this one would have to be modified at your expense. This is not a One-Size-Fits all type of Jig.""Considering the number of reviews I've read through the past couple days, no one mentioned this little factoid and a couple reviewers had the same brand saw as mine. Hope this helps someone out there!"
5,Nice adder!,"I shopped for a good tenoning jig for my Delta contractors saw, looking at several different brands from a host of other manufacturers/suppliers. I settled on the Delta unit because of the quality of the unit, the excellent repeatability, and ease of set-up. Good job, Delta!"
1,Does not fit Craftsman table saw.,"I have seen this jig in operation at the wood shows in the past. This is an excellent jig and should be made available to those of us who own a Craftsman Table Saw. Some of the tool catalogs state that it will not fit a Craftsman, but most don't. I have purshased this jig, only to find out that it did not fit. I have talked with Delta, and suggested that they put an adjustable bar on the jig, but for some reason they do not want to. In one of my wood magazines, there was an article on this jig and it stated that Delta was coming out with a new modle this year, but in the next issue, they had to retract their article. This jig deserves to be rated as a 5 based on its performace, but I had to give it a 1 based on the availability. If you desire to change my rating to a 5, based on your guidelines, that would be fine. Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to express my opinion."
4,"an odd combination of genres, almost experimental","this book kind of compresses in on itself. it starts out rather ironic and almost lighthearted in it's absurdity, but the closing chapters are chilling and heartbreaking. an odd mixture of humor, adventure, romance, study of reality and lots of other things, this is a fine work and amazingly modern. what made it all the more fine was the 1930's edition i found.... all the smell of old books and those lovely margin notes by previous owners!"
2,"Great story, terrible printing (beware S&P)","The story is terrific, classic Conrad. The printing is rubbish though (I am referring to the version published by S&P; with the sandy shore on the cover). The font size is miniscule - almost impossible to read - while the book's title is printed in an enormous font at the top of every page. It looks like a PDF gone wrong.Get the book, but from a decent publisher. There is no way I'm buying another S&P; product."
2,I had a very hard time getting into this book.,The characters were well defined but not believeable. It did win me over in the end but it was hard getting there. Especially the 9 year old daughter. Her dialogue was not like any other 9 year old I have ever heard.
2,I wanted to like this book,"What a disappointment. I thought this would be an intelligent look at the stay at home/keep working dilemma. But in the end of this book, the husband gets a $400,000/year job offer. Dilemma solved. The author should be ashamed of herself."
1,yawn.,"I'm a male in my mid 20's, and was given a copy of this by my mother...Granted I may not be the target audience, but I don't think I could imagine a more boring or detached central character. A selfish, judgmental and frankly meanspirited character, her instincts are more paranoid than concerned, isolationist than focused, and submissive versus empowering.Anyone who reads this and see this character as a positive female roll model would be happiest watching Leave it to Beaver reruns and spend the rest of the time daydreaming about a husband.Overall, a disinteresting and predicable story with the irrelevant values of a age long gone. At best, it's cute. At worst, it's attempting to advocate a worldview that thankfully has gone the way of the bridal dowry."
3,I guess I identified with the main character.,"That's why I intrinsically like this book better than others here. Yes, the writing was simplistic. But that's ok. It's nice to just breeze through a chatty book now and again. The characters were caricatures; exagerated for effect. Not bad, really, just entertaining.I agree, the solution in the end was disappointing. She didn't have to make a decision and commit. However, Amanda realizes she doesn't want to be a crusader for either side of the feminist issue. She just wants to mother her children. And I appreciate that.I completely disagree that Amanda didn't want the baby. The baby may have been an ill-timed surprise, but obviously is very much wanted. That's a major plot point, I thought."
1,So disappointed!,"Despite the negative reviews, I hoped there would be something light and fluffy and distracting for the few moments when I get to read. There wasn't. This is not a book about a stay-at-home mom, it is a book about a DOJ lawyer's career travails as experienced by his stay-at-home wife. The beginning and end have a few insights into the feelings of a woman who quit work to stay at home, and there are a few witty lines. In between, there is a long arduous tale of an idealistic lawyer who decides his idealism is misplaced.Where are the kids? After reading the whole book I couldn't even give you a description of them, except to say that the son has some problems with aggression. I think most stay-at-home moms spend most of their mental energy on the kids, with all the sometimes mundane and sometimes delightful details that involves. But apparently kids aren't interesting enough for the author, so she chose to write a book about Washington politics instead."
2,If life stinks money will fix everything,"I bought this book thinking that I could relate to the main character Amanda, a fulltime mother with two small children. After a couple of chapters the book went in a completly different direction and it focused more on her husband's job at the justice department then on the struggles of being a mom. The end of the book wasn't any better, with Amanda and her baby almost dying but everything being okay because of money. It would be nice if life were like a fairy tale but it's not so I had trouble feeling any compassion for Amanda or any of the characters in the book. Not a very good read."
5,Another Great Corelle Product,"I'd ordered the Corelle 34 piece set in Just White -by the way, I cannot recommend that enough -great product -but decided I needed another, larger bowl than the one that came with the set. The Winter Frost White 2-Quart bowl matches nicely enough with the other set, and is the usual dependable Corelle. I imagine I'll have this set in tact for years to come."
1,Lousy remakes. Buy Greatest Country Hits for the real versions,"Many of the songs on this release are re-recordings of the hit versions, recorded to sound like the originals. But they aren't, and if you are familiar with the originals, these won't satisfy you.The original hits, original recordings, are easily available on this release:Greatest Country Hits. There's no point in buying this. None at all."
2,not all copper,"Vantec Iceberq product CCB-A1C (copper) contains three heatsinks. The one with the built-in fan is copper, the other two are copper colored aluminum."
1,bad service,"i made an order for 63"" fat white shoelaces. i recieved skinny laces. i called back to return and they ""dont carry fat laces 63"" in white"", the website says otherwise. better of going to footlocker"
1,Very cheap,These are so cheaply made that nearly every case had a broken plastic tab used to hold the case shut. I ended up throwing most of them away.I could not recommend this product.
3,An improvement,"This book is a sign Goltz has matured since writing ""Requiem"" and ""AZ Diary"", and has found his niche. This is to say, maybe he's realized he isn't much for political synthesis or history. He has obviously done a lot of good and original thinking about journalistic ethics in wartime and the ""Hawthorne effect""--these are the reasons you want to read this book.There are a lot of books, historical and journalistic, in several languages, on Chechnya and this is the least exciting and informative of the ten or so of those I've read.""Allah's Mountains"", ""Chechnya--Tombstone of Russian Power"" and ""Chechnya--A Short, Victorious War"" are more interesting and written by less self-obsessed authors."
4,Good book,"I liked SPIN SELLING better as they both covered the same ground with similar approach, but SPIN SELLING seemed better researched and had 4 steps where this had 9. Spin Selling was a better read too.However, it is entirely possible that had I read this before reading Spin Selling, I would have gained more from this, and hence liked it more."
4,Great flick,"Good story, good portrayal of the charactors from the book. DeNiro as always nailed the role and DeCaprio was clearly an up and comer."
3,Leo above all!,"As a De Niro fan, I guess I should never say this, but I'm going to say (write) it anyway: Leo di Caprio steals the picture here! Only in ""What's eating Gilbert Grape"" have I seen him giving such an absolutely stunning performance, stealing the picture to Johnny Depp, another great actor that I admire.""This boy's life"" is certainly not a milestone in De Niro's career. In fact this movie closed somehow a period during which he has made a string of mediocre movies, such as ""Guilty by Suspicion"", ""Backdraft"", ""Capefear"", ""Mistress"" and ""Night and the City"", and he went on later to give stunning performances in great movies such as ""Heat"", ""Casino"" and ""Sleepers"". Although I like De Niro and di Caprio, to me ""This boy's life"" is just a watchable movie. The best thing this movie brought to the audience is di Caprio who, I'm sure, will certainly give other remarkable performances throughout his long and, I hope, illustrious career."
4,Good for those interested in geneaology,"This is a great book for people interested in their family history, especially if they think their family is from the Southern States. It has names, dates of marriages, deaths, and births, and places of marriages, deaths, and births of hundreds of people. It is very informative and well documented, and not too difficult to decipher. This can be very helpful."
1,HORRIBLE.,"This Phone is terrible. I would NOT reccomnd this phone to ANYONE.From day One, I have had problems with it turning off for no reason. Even with a full battery. It just shuts off at Random times. I've taken it in and they can't do anything about it. I have asked other people, randomly on the street once I see them wit hthe phone if they have the same problem, and they can relate!-IT FREEZES Constantly.-A very slow phone.-It falls apart easily.-camera is terrible.I will NEVER buy Siemens again."
1,didn't work,Items that do not work should not be sold it is like a scam and I was mislead or ripped off
3,Marginal voltage,Works to drive my 90 watt circulating pump when modified sine wave would not. Output voltage is low though (using RMS voltmeter) - only get about 100 volts out.
5,Excellent product and service,"I have always loved Corelle. When I moved into my new house, I decided to indulge myself in new dishes. After comparing several websites, I chose Amazon. Not only was the price the best, but I have had excellent service from Amazon.com in the past.This experience was absolutely wonderful. The dishes arrived in perfect condition, on time, no breakage, not a chip on any piece. I was thrilled.I will use Amazon.com again and will recommend it to all my friends."
1,"Avoid this movie, save your money and time.","I couldn't get through 15 minutes of this movie. The animation is amateurish and dated. The writing is as if he wrote a scene, animated as quickly as he could and then wrote another scene. It feels like a stream of consciousness, unedited, and in its first draft. Talentless crap. Within the first 13 minutes the plot is established. You realize that this is self-indulgent crap, because it is about a singer-song writer searching for a tune, so that he can keep his job, and keep his girl. This is explained by the main character. ""I need to write a song to that I can keep my job and my girl friend."" There are a few interesting animations that might make an interesting graphic for an album, but nothing in this random assault of imagery justifies a movie.If you made it through that poorly written review, imagine a movie of lower caliber, less wit, and sketchier organization, and that is the movie ""The Tune"" is.Avoid it."
4,This book was great!,"I read this book when I was a teenager and now I can still remember this book 15 years later. I really identified with the main character, Jennifer, who can't go a day without her fix of television programs. When she's transferred from an all girls' school to a co-ed school, she's afraid that her real life might be more than she can handle. TV's safer for her to lose herself in. A great book!"
3,Worth the money but could have more information,"I found this book to be helpful in reviewing my wine buying selections before I got to the store. The book is too big to carry with you when shopping. I also use it to find the ratings of wines that I have already bought. Besides individual rankings there is little else the book adds to ones wine knowledge. An included cd version with the book would have been a great addition. It's definitely a great resource to find out how a particular wine rates just don't expect to learn much about particular wine growing regions, buying tips, etc."
4,Well constructed for the casual wine buff,"Wine Spectator seems to have an excellent feel for who its audience is and what they want in a wine guide. Similar books by Hugh Johnson and Oz Clarke either skimp on the details with their pocket guides or inundate you with details in Encyclopedia sized tomes. This guide has just the right mix of extensive reviews, top 100 lists from recent years, current value wines, and summaries of the great wine growing regions.The regional summaries give you almost everything you need to know about classifications, primary varietals, labeling practices, etc. One suggesiton would be to include sample labels from each region to make shopping a little easier. Another would be to realign the Burgundy reviews to group them together in a less confusing fashion.The pull-out vintage charts and wine-buying strategies are the icing on the cake. Now, if only they would offer an addendum (as well as a complete volume release) each year to keep prior customers up to date...Cheers"
5,A True Genious,Rings of Saturn is phenomenal! A must for every jazz lover . . . simply a must. Guaranteed to bring joy to your ears! Hooker is truly a genious.
1,DON'T TRUST!!!,"I checked the (year, make, model) of my car on the description page and it said, ""This product fits your CAR"". So I happily ordered it and waited for it to be shipped. Then I took it to my mechanic for installation and that was when we found it won't fit. In fact, he showed me another car in his shop that was compatible with the part and guess what? when I checked the page, it said ""This product does not fit"" !!So, I would suggest unless you know for sure this part fits you car, DON'T BUY IT!"
1,Might be good as a personal defense item.,"I tried it on a PC(xp and windows 7 64 and 32 bit) a Mac and even a linux box with powered hubs on all the different systems and it simply will not do anything. I must not have read the disclaimer about this being a replica of a functional microphone. Not sure how any company can send out things DOA, you would think they could test them or something! What a hassle and time and money wasted"
2,Help,I got this mic a few days ago and installed the software that came with it. No matter what I do though I am not able to record anything... If anybody could help me out I'd appreciate it
4,Nice and Affordable,"The first impression I got when I received the mic was the heft of it. It's made of metal and is kinda heavy, but better to put up with a little heaviness than breaking cheap plastic. It sounds great. It works great on MAC OS snow leapard and lion as well as windows. I recommend it."
2,Does Not work with Vista,"""Samson C01U USB mic records low volume on Vista.This is a known behavior with the Samson Mic and the Vista operating system and is not specific with Camtasia Studio. Be sure to turn your recording volume up and speak directly into the microphone to obtain a good recording level. ""The above is copied from the Camtasia Web site. This is apparently a well known problem with Vista. I'm encountering it too."
5,Plug In and Go.,"Great sound for the money. Perfect for my podcasts and even my audio cd reports. Simplest installation ever, just plugged it into USB and done."
4,good mic,"i use this mic for recording music with garageband on my mac. i don't have much of a recording studio setup, so i always end up with fuzz, but this mic made a significant improvement on that, as well as just working a whole lot better than the built in mic on the computetr. I feel it was well worth the money and would recommend the mic for a beginner musician like me, it may or may not be professional quality, i just don't know. but it works well for both guitar and singing."
3,Decent quality,Quality is good for beginner uses. Stand needs some manipulation to put it in the right position where it won't topple over.
4,Delivery Delay,"Not sure what the mix-up was ... took several weeks to get the microphone. Once I sent a query to the provider, it seems like everythign was straightened out and the order promptly sent out."
5,I like it,"I like this mic. I upgraded from a less expensive microphone, for making Camtasia web recordings --- Techsmith recommends this mic for working with their recording software. Took it out of the box, plugged it in, it worked straight-away. And the sound is good. (I have not installed the Samson software)."
3,Missing part and problem with software,I am very satisfied with the microphone quality but I suspect is was a return because it did not come with the collar that fastens it to my stand.I chose the microphone because I liked the same one I dropped and broke but this one came with different software that didn't work on my 2004 Mac.I didn't return it because I use the collar from my broken mic and the new mic works without the software.It has great sound quality.
4,Great Microphone,I like this product and I would reccommend anyone to buy one.Great quality micropnone
1,PIECE OF YOU-KNOW-WHAT!!!,"This item was cute and pretty easy to set up (you do need an electric pump-the pump they give you would take 2 days to inflate the bed).Within 2 hours, there was a hole in a seam. All my six year old did was sit on it to watch tv.This item is poorly made if it can not withstand a six year old sitting on it."
3,For completists,"I don't think that this is Mylene's best album. Besides the hit singles ""Sans contrefacon"" (a top-50-hit in Germany), ""Allan"", and ""Sans logique"", I don't care much for this CD. The other songs are not bad, but often boring and uninspired. I recommend you to buy ""Dance Mixes"" instead, featuring three songs from this album."
1,Cheap,"Cheaply produced with poor audio; over-the-top laughable acting; storyline that had potential but lacked plot development, character depth and believability. Probably just not enough money, time and commitment to making this movie as good as it's potential."
5,arrived on time,The tablets arrived on time as expected.Great price for the tablets.i could not find a comparable price anywhere on line.
5,the children of marx and coca cola on the big screen,"A great movie. An interesting stop in Godard's career. A pseudo-revolutionary and a pop singer have an odd relationship. It is worth it to watch this one alongside ""Pierrot Le Fou,"" because the two movies are different yet at the same time quite fluid. In fact, if this one does not hook you, I would give ""Pierrot"" a try and then come back to ""Masculin/Feminin."" Jean-Pierre Leaud (from The 400 Blows) is particularly excellent in this film."
3,Odd typeface and layout,"I'm about 1/2 way through the book, and the advice seems helpful, though similar to what I've read in other books on the subject of ADHD and/or foster children. I'd rate it as a good book on that perspective. However, the typface and layout of the text are horrible. So much so that they are distracting. All of the text is written in Comic Sans font, which is really not suitable for lengthy reading. It's also ALL bold, with a font size of about 16. Again, it makes it difficult to sit and read. Lastly, the author's writing style is very informal, and borders on annoying. She likes to put exclamation points after two! And even sometimes THREE sentences in a row! It gets tiresome.In summary: good advice for the topic, but the formatting is so horrible that it's difficult to read."
1,boring,"this movies was extremely boring and pointless to waste my money on renting. It should be a free movie, not one to pay for....boring boring boring!!"
2,"Oh, MY!!!!","Not sure what to think of this. The cinematography was really good, but the script was really disjointed. It might have been easier to like if it were not for arguably the WORST job of sound mixing in the history of the film industry. Trying to hear the whispers behind the music was nearly impossible. Without knowing what was said, the ability to join together the various segments was lost. I think the only reason this film got a nomination for best picture was to make The Descendant look better."
2,Sometimes less is more,"Well, this movie is very emotional, has some great meanings and teachings for everyone. But in the other hand, and my personal opinion, i fell like the movie tries so damn hard to make some points, i get simbolism, but it gets really annoying when is overcharged with it, for example what was the reason of the first 40 minutes of the movie?, it would be easily be done the exact same concept in 10.Is a nice movie, but thats all for me, i wouldnt see it again. With great potencial, i fell like the movie was kill for its overproduction."
1,Worst date movie EVER!,"Warning!: ""The Tree of Life"" is not a very good date movie. If David Lynch and Stanley Kubrick had a baby, while using LSD and channeling Hunter S. Thompson-that would be this movie. Please, for the love of God, do not subject yourself or others to this experiment in despair fraught with death, space nebulae, dinosaur on dinosaur violence, volcanoes and Brad Pitt. I am not responsible if you choose not to heed my warning. Choose well.....Oh, and my date promptly left after 30 minutes. Thats right, this movie killed my date night!"
1,Don't waste your time!,"Do something, anything, else. It was really, really boring. Hats off to you if you can find anything worthwhile in this sucky movie."
1,WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT ?????????????,I thought that the actors should pay everyone who spent even a dime for this movie back. If it was supposed to be some type of artistic look at life it was a complete bomb. Anyone who gives this thing a rating more then one star is trying to sound as if they are above everyone elses level of understanding art. This was CRAP without any redeeming value whatsoever.
1,Dull,"What a dreadful movie. I'd read all sorts of great reviews, and like artsy movies in general, but this was far too confusing and abstract. I really disliked this movie and wish I could get a refund!"
1,One instance where Amazon ratings DECEIVED me,"I should have read the one star reviews before renting this movie. What was Brad Pitt thinking when he played a role in this move??? When you think ""Brad Pitt,"" this kind of movie does not come to most people's minds (certainly not mine). Talk about plotless, confusing and boring. I had to fast forward and the only scene that caused me to pause for a moment were the dinosaurs - I was hoping that the movie got better. I just gave up and not bothered watching the rest of the movie. $3.99 down the drain."
5,Not a film for everyone,"This is not a film for everyone, but I believe this to be one of the greatest cinematic achievements. Yes, it's visually stunning, but there is so much more. For the people who get discouraged after watching 25 minutes of it, or even finish the film but feel it was over ambitious and confusing, you're dealing Malick not Scorsese. Terrence Malik presents films that are meant to be watched over and over again because they need to be digested and reflected on. There are layers of metaphors and symbolism in what I believe to be his greatest achievement. It wasn't meant to be watched like 'Ordinary People' or 'Casablanca', dramas that are explained fully on the surface, but like '2001: A Space Odyssey'. It's a thinkers film."
3,NO SLIPCOVER,"It came without the slipcover! WHO DOES THAT TO A PERSON???Everything is fantasmical though, and the picture and audio are just orgasmic."
1,a swing and a miss,"This is not a movie, but rather an ""art film"". The sad thing is, it is not a very good one. Don't waste your time. I believe your time would be better spent stargazing, walking along the beach, or taking a long hike."
4,more mood poem than film narrative,"This is not your run of the mill film with a linear story, but instead is a brilliantly impressionistic piece that mingles a disjointed plot with images - of nebulae, aquatic creatures, even of dinosaurs, and paint blobs akin to 2001's descent into infinite. All the while vivid music adds to the mood. It is hard to piece the story together and hard to concentrate on the film, though if one does there is a genuine lyrical beauty to it.The story is about a troubled family from the early 1960s. While there is much love in the family, there is also an authoritarian father (in a rare good performance by Brad Pitt), needy kids, and soulful mother, who is in crisis because her religion has failed to protect her from the death of a child. The moods are very strong, offering clues to the disjointed storytelling, forcing the viewer to fill in the dots.In the end, it is a matter of personal taste. I liked the film very much, though my attention wandered a bit."
1,The Absolute Worst,The worst movie I've seen in years. Over the top pretentious. I would have left a third of the way through but I thought my wife wanted to see it only to find out after it ended that she felt the same as me. We wondered why so many big names signed on for it. I've since read Sean Penn's remarks that the original script was wonderful. He implied that something went terribly wrong in the production. The story of the working class Texas family could have made a good movie but it was overwhelmed by the simplistic scientific and religious shell in which it was placed. Maybe it was meant to appeal to religious fundamentalists but then there was all that evolutionary stuff. All in all a genuinely awful movie. Worth seeing only if you enjoy train wrecks. But wait for Netflix.
4,made me cry,"I think if I were an American, especially from the mid west, I would have cried a lot. Very interesting, well worth watching, or perhaps worth suffering through."
5,Beautiful,"This is the most beautiful film I have ever seen. To enjoy it, though, you should go in with a questioning mind about deep subjects - the nature of man and the existence of god. If that's not for you, this movie isn't probably for you either."
1,Not worth your time,"I wish i would have never watched this movie, hard to follow, very abstract, does not hold your interest at all. it would serve better as a screensaver on your desktop."
5,Very special movie. Superb video quality!!,The Tree of Life is a beautiful shot movie and it really shows on the blu ray.I own 100 blu rays and this one is in my top 3 of all time regarding the video quality!
5,Very Humorous Book,"I thought the book was an excellent kids book. The pictures were very eye-catching. I liked this book because the dog was a bottom-less pit, eating everything in sight. This is pretty funny to me. It made me laugh up a storm."
3,Disappointed in the craftsmanship,"I was so excited to find this wardrobe for my daughters American Girl clothes and couldn't wait to give it to her for her birthday. It seemed sturdy enough when I removed it from the package, and the wood was of a decent thickness. But, the hinge on the bi-fold door came apart after it had been opened a total of 3 times!!!! Talk about disappointing. And, of course, my daughter was rather upset.It will go back to Target as soon as possible and hopefully the replacement will last a little longer."
4,Interesting and refreshing,"Stephan Eischer is Swiss, and his music reflects the modern multi-cultural influences in Switzerland today. He sings in English, French, and Swiss-German on this album. The music evokes the rural countryside (cowbells in 'Es Ist Alles'!), the U.S. pop music influence ('I'm so lonesome I could Cry'--with an accent), thoughtful acoustic balladeer in 'Tu ne me dois rien' (you don't owe me a thing), and Mediterranean fury in 'Dejeuner en Paix'. His voice sounds natural, neither over-produced nor obscured by the varied arrangements. I used to live in Switzerland, which is how I learned about his music. Give it a try. Pleasant pop with a European twist and some interesting lyrics."
4,Comprehensive and thorough in its scope.,"Louise and Orvelo Wood have provided an excellent and comprehensive guide to papermaking. Its black and white photographs are well done if antiquated. The directions for each example are thorough and easy to read and follow. Teachers and students alike would have trouble running out of projects and ideas with this guide. Science, reading, math teachers would all benefit from using the suggestions in this book as a suppliment for teaching. Art teachers wuold find it an excellent reference book on all kinds of paper projects. For many years people of all ages have enjoyed the projects explained in this book, some of which are difficult to find in other books. It is a great reference book and fun for everybody!"
4,"Good, but not perfect","I thought this was a dish that I could use on the stovetop, it is not. Please be aware if you are looking for something to use on the stovetop this will not serve your purpose."
4,Good value,"This pad is a lot cheaper than some of the other options, but is still very comfortable. It's perfect for car camping and casual trips, but might be too heavy for serious hikers. Make sure to open it and let it fully inflate at least once before you use it, and keep in mind that it's recommended that you store it inflated with the valve open to preserve the memory foam so it can self-inflate easily."
4,"Great pad, very well constructed","Yes, this pad takes a very long time to inflate the first time it is opened. I left them on the ground for several hours before they completely inflated the first time. However, they are surprisingly comfy for camping. My boyfriend and I slept on them no problem for 3 nights in a row. I do notice that they take about 15 minutes to completely self inflate, but when I'm impatient I'll let them inflate most of the way and then blow into them for the last bit at the end of the mad which seems to take the longest."
5,old fat & love to camp,Thirty-five years ago I could sleep on the bare ground and wake up well rested. Since then I seem to have got out of practice. Nowadays the super- sized 4 inch thick mattress has more charm than the rocks and stumps of old times. Unlike some other products this one really is as thick as it claims. I measured.
4,Not the best comparison between the two systems...,"While interesting, this book doesn't give any good arguments exegetically. Hunt, like Geisler, is a philosopher and not an exegetical scholar. He admits freely that his arguments come from more of a philosophical stance, so that is what you are going to get whenever you read Hunt. White, on the other hand, simply repeats exegetical work already done via Grudem and Ware. By not going deep enough exegetically, White ends up with circular reasoning to prove his points.If you want in-depth exegetical work on these topics, you really have read C. Gordon Olson's ""Beyond Calvinism and Arminianism: An Inductive, Mediate Theology of Salvation."" For a compilation of reformed writers and their numerous disagreements, see Vance's ""The Other Side of Calvinism."" And for more exegetical work, see Dillow's ""The Reign of the Servant Kings."""
3,Calvinism and then the truth,"I would have to guess that most non calvinist do not sweat thisissue. It's just plain common sense. How could anyone look at both sides and agree with calvinism? Dave Hunt Makes perfect sense and James White avoids questions and grabs at staws.I say these things not to start an arguement with a calvinist.I've been there before. Might as well beat your head against the wall,or argue with a three year old,it will do you just as good.If you want to read how a loving God sends people to Hell with no choice, and is happy to do so, James White can tell you all about it in this book. If you want to know the truth,Dave Hunt'shalf does just that."
2,Easy yet uncomfortable to wear,"This silicone garmet belt is very easy to put on. It's like a big piece of tape that you wrap on to your body and won't fall down. However, if you are wearing it for a little while, it is ok. If you are planning to wear it for hours to half a day, this is not a product you want to use. Usually the scar is not as big as the area of the whole sheet that covers your body, but you have to cover a large area of your body in order for the velcros to secure the sheet. There will be a large area of your skin not able to breath any air for a long time. After I use it for a few hours, I started to feel itchy, hot and uncomfortable. After trying it for 3 times (I wore it for 6-8 hours per day), I started to get some rashes on my skin. After consulting with my doctor, he told me to use the small silicone strips just enough to cover the scar itself, which has been working better for me."
3,Okay as a binder.,It is a good binder but is pretty hot and makes me itch along my scar area. I have used Scar Away c-section strips and they are more comfortable. It would have been nice if the two were combined.
3,Good in money pinch.,"This muzzle does work, but my dog had holes in it within 3 days. Luckily, I knew how to sew, and put it back to where he wouldn't rip it all the way down. Make sure if it's not on your dog, it goes up t where he/she can't reach, and keep their nails trimmed!Overall, good product :)"
1,Tore before we got to play with it,"While I knew this would be great fun for my kids.... trying to get it together was very agitating. The guides for the poles tore the first time we tried to put the tent up, and it was very unclear how to actually make the poles successfully get to where they were supposed to go. If the instructions were more clear, and the support poles were one piece of flexible rod, as opposed to a string enforced magnetic/separable rod, I think it would work better. I give it a thumbs down for durability and construction, but I think it would have been fun if we had ever gotten it together :("
1,This book is just plain wrong,"This book has nothing to do with true Catholicism. If you want to be lulled some more into the liberal thinking that everything is okay than I am praying for you. The Catholic Church is the protector of Divine Truth whether we like it or not. And it will not change its doctrine!! Our parish (OLV in Birmingham, AL) is promoting this book when what we really need is TRUTH! The priests and bishops allowing this to happen are in serious danger as they are leading their sheep astray. I pray for them daily."
1,Utter pablum,"Reviewer: emareyAccording to Paul Wilkes, ""successful"" Catholics know that unlike in ""the past"" there isn't just one answer to various issues such as whether the priesthood should be all male and celibate, whether Christ is really present in the Eucharist, or whether contraception is permissible. Oh, but there is, Paul-- and it's called Catholic doctrine.There are plenty of churches which don't feature an authoritative hierarchy and binding dogma, but the Roman Catholic church isn't one of them. Wilkes' definition of a successful Catholic (sort of presumptive to define, isn't it?) is apparently someone who is either ignorant of church teaching or willfully disobedient to it.This book is shallow, wrongheaded and dishonest all at once. You'll get more spiritual and intellectual nourishment watching daytime television."
1,"Not invisible, simply nothing there","A droopy lead character: like a Debbie Downer, who always finds the down side. There is no ending, just a last page, and you say, ""that's it?"" And why this doctor doesn't realize he is suffering from depression, and write himself a prescription for prozac? But here's my prescription for the author: don't write books anymore, and all will be well."
1,I wasn't pleased!,"This happens everytime. The professional mixers extend the song too far! You loose everything that is so good about the song. Its all techno and the lyrics are ocasionally blurted. And I didn't care for this CD, nore do I care for most of the remix's that these producers make. Its a shame. But every now and then I enjoy listening to them. They're nice while I'm sitting at my desk and I'm paying no attention to the song at all. Its often nioce backround music. Even though its supposed to be blasted at some club. I would just blast the real thing!-Ellery~~Enjoy =)"
5,If you love dance music !,"If you love dance music you'll like this single,unlike the album version, it contains remixes that has a beat you can dance to.I even heard some of the local clubs play it too.."
4,"Vikings, Adventure, Sidney Poitier, Richard Widmark, what more could you want??","Saw this when released to theater (yes that old) and have watched now and gain since then. A great Viking adventure with a very young Sidney Poitier and (I always liked the guy)Richard Widmark. Paced well and a decent enough plot but mostly its Vikings in Viking ships. When is last time you saw a Viking Movie?? Could be a ""data night"" movie as no graphic violence and no foul language."
4,Great Matinee Entertainment,I think that this DVD (super transfer)proves a point that there is still a market for this form of entertaiment and without a doubt is far superior to most of the trash we get nowadays in the cinema. Its not that often one can say that this is a Family Movie and a very good one at that. I cant wait for more titles like this
3,A 1964 Viking Epic Film,"It is two or three stars - no more. This is simply an average to bad Viking film. Unless you love Viking films, do not waste your time. Sidney Poitier stars in this film, but it is probably the worst film of his career. The acting in this film is not realistic and seems kind of hokey. The story is about searching for and finding a huge golden bell."
1,No dvd inside of package!,"there was no dvd inside of package, Imagine the embaressment as i opened the ""sealed"" DVD in frontof some family and out pops Nothing!!! please get back with me on this one, Thank you very much, i really wanted to watch this movie"
4,Good movie Id recommend it!,"The way the teenagers talked got on my nerves, but it was a good story, and I love Anne Hathaway!"
1,Anne please don't do this again.,"Why? because your image is beautiful, classy, pure, important. You do not need to get involved with crap like this because you are much better than that. I love you but don't turn me off like this again. Do the hit woman or the fairy tales or romance just anything but the ghetto stuff."
2,Anne Hathaway should be ashamed,"Anne Hathaway should be ashamed to have show nudity in this movie. How could she, after being in Disney movies go and show her naked breast in this movie. Shes such a talented actress that it was not necessary for her to do so. I found this move do be average, and an partially enjoyable movie to watch, except for Anne Hathaway's naked breasts. I do hope Anne will not do anymore nude moments in movie."
3,Not a great movie but not bad either,"I saw this movie the other night and decided it wasnt a waste of time. It actually contains a story. If you have some spare time and you can rent it, get it for cheap or watch it on IFC you wont be disappointed."
3,Havoc... Decent,"I read` a lot of negative reviews here which I personally think are way too judgmental. I just viewed the movie and I think its much deeper than people give it credit for. The story has been told before.. I grant you that, but still the acting and the emotions are believable. Rich kids looking for a ""real"" experience so they get hooked up with gangsters and their troubles.Anne Hathaway gives a good performance as a smart ass kid who wants to get away from her boring life into the unknowns of downtown LA. She kooks up with a group of gangsters known as the 16th street gang. He interactions gives her more of a learning experience than she wanted. Throughout the process she is somewhat composed, but still frazzle when things go wrong.At the end things go horribly wrong and hard lessons are learned. The whole nude thing is way overrated. Its not THAT shocking. The story and the way its played out is satisfying enough."
3,good movie,i like the movie alot i seen this movie before when i seen it on the amazon and saw the movie i had to get it this movie is really interesting and good
3,crash lite,"just see it for the ladies, because other than that it is like crash. Well wait this came out before Crash so..oh who cares. end result is the gang bangers bump heads with the wanna be gb's and it all goes downhill from there. Bayou Phillips is hot and so is Hathaway if you know what I am talking about so if you are looking for that kind of action it is here. Really now, good acting and neat story. Just that, well kind of not realistic, like the girls trying to get into a gang and stuff. Any teen that does something THAT dumb needs to start over in the first grade or just be admitted into an asylum."
2,Someone shoulda busteed a cap in all of 'em!,"So, in this movie, Anne Hathaway tries to show us she has ""range"" by showing us her um, assets (I tried to use another word, but Amazon wouldn't accept my review). Great. Congratulations sweetie, you're a serious actress now.Nothing in this movie is real. If people actually behaved the way the kids in this movie did in real life, they would wind up dead in a ditch. Freddy RodrÃ­guez plays a gangster with a heart of gold who puts up with the shenanigans of a bunch of bored, spoiled wealthy teenagers. I would have put a cap in all of their faces early on and been done with it. Insipid waste of time."
3,"RICH, BORED, STUPID TEENS CROSS THE LINE","Not on the same level as Kids or Bully, HAVOC UNRATED (New Line) is about rich, bored and stupid Pacific Palisades teens who've adopted a hip-hop ""gangsta"" pose. One thing leads to another and two of the Palisades' girls find they've crossed the line and are in a dangerous situation with a real gang of East L.A. Latino drug dealers.The main draw of this direct to DVD release is squeaky-clean Anne Hathaway's (Princess Diaries) portrayal of Allie, replete with foul language and nudity. Hathaway is very believable in this unsettling portrayal of a girl suddenly discovering a much darker and more dangerous reality in her worldUnrated. Genre: Teen crime. 1 Hour, 32 Minutes. Starring: Anne Hathaway, Bijou Philips, Freddy Rodriguez. Director: Barbara Kopple."
5,literally perfect in every way....,"I can't believe I snagged this hard-to-find pressing, and for less than $10. I honestly expected this record to be impossible to find.The vinyl is in absolutely perfect condition, sounds great. And the graphics on the sleeve are rad!"
5,"For the price, these cannot be beat!","I ordered these because members in my household kept breaking my much more expensive plates. I didn't expect much from these and didn't realize how much I would learn to like these plates. I really like the pattern; grows on you. Plus they do not take up any room in your dishwasher or cabinets! Can't go wrong with these plates for the price. I have had no problem with chips, scratches, or discoloration. Comes out of the dishwasher looking brand new. Great everyday plates."
4,"Air, by Peter Kater","The CD is very relaxing, serves the purpose of what I purchased it for. It does complement the massage time. It is consistant with the other CDs I have by Peter Kater."
5,Neat little item,If you have a massively mini media player you definately want to get this to go with it. My children love there mini media player and this item helps them recharge it without using the computer. For a kid product it sure works good.
1,Poor luck baking with Stevia,"This is the second stevia baking book I have tried. Did not have good luck with this one or the other one. Stevia seems to work when baking with fruit as a supplement to the sweetness, but I have not been successful with chocolate cake or brownies. My tastebuds get two sensations, first of bitter unsweetened cocoa, then an aftertaste of sweetness, but these two do not seem to come at the same time. So far stevia tastes good only in my coffee!"
5,chewable papaya enyzme,"This product is a great substitute for other heartburn remedies such as rolaids, etc. Healthier to use. Happy to be able to purchase it from Amazon as I live in a small town where this product would not be available. Would have to travel 75 miles to a health food store."
3,50/50,This game was great yet bad. Awsome grafics but some levels (Midway) for example are to difficult. But overall I enjoyed it. Perfect game for experienced gamers.
3,Pretty Fun,Pretty fun game overall. Can be quite difficult. I had to go online to some forums to find some tips to get through several levels. But overall a good game.
4,wow,bonnie is back and she once more proves she a legend and still as sexy as ever on i cant help you now and on gnwin on it what a track you keep rockin bonnie you bad
4,Great for Taylor 12 strings...,"...silky smooth and they tone down the ""bright"" Taylor sound just a bit...which must be why Taylor sells all their new guitars with elixirs.Warning: In the ""light"" set, the .009 sympathetic G string is REALLY easy to BREAK. It can handle about one full pitch above its normal G...and then, pop! Gone.I have gotten 1+ year on a set of these w/o breaks, but have also broken the .009 on the 3rd day once when I cranked it the wrong way a full pitch up (instead of down) while setting up for a DGDDAD song.Elixir does offer the .009 as a single string listed on their website on the hard to find ""single string"" page ( [...] ) under the heading ""Anti-Rust Plated Plain Steels"" item #13009.Amazon does not currently stock these single strings, but several vendors linked to from the page above do. They run $1.09 each and can be special ordered from any music shop that carries Elixirs.Elixir should sell these .009s in sets of 10 because that's how fragile they are. ;-)"
3,Stiff price for mediocre tone quality.,"I asked my wife to order this set for my birthday as I can get a set of Martins installed for about the same price as the Elixirs in the package. I was curious to see how long they would hold a fresh intonation for their premium price.After installation & tuning, I immediately noticed the strings lacked the extended ""ring"" of a fresh set Martins, actually sounding like they had been casually played for a couple of weeks or so. That's O.K. for rehearsal, but a bit too dull for performance. So far they sound the same after a month of playing- perhaps that's the advantage, but I suspect the advertised special process dulls the sound one would expect from a fresh set of Martins."
4,"Caution, arachnophobes","My 14-month-old child enjoys this book, with its bright colors and crisp photos of interesting items and smiling children.One caveat - I am arachnophobic and nearly threw the book across the room when I glimpsed a spider on the black and white page. My husband ""repaired"" it by putting electrical tape over the offending picture, so I can now read the book with my daughter. But I just wanted to warn all other parents who cannot abide the sight of a spider."
5,loved it!,"really loved this book! Was such an adorable, innocent kind of a story, One of its kind. This one is definately on the bucket list."
3,A cute story.,"A cute and well written book. It offers a glimpse of the early 1900s in the United States. It would be a great read for a budding writer. Creationist be advised that there is a statement in the book concerning evolutional beliefs ""I didn't know that people used to be monkeys and that the Garden of Eden was a beautiful myth""."
3,"Great story, wonky c.d.s","I absolutely love the story of ""Daddy Long Legs"". It is one of my all-time favorite books. I wanted to have the story on cd because I have a long commute, but I had trouble getting some of the cds to work in my car stereo. I bought a second copy, but have not yet had time to see if I have the same problem."
5,silver streak,great air gun. great for varmits. I like the bigger pellet. Does not have to be pumped all the way up for power.
3,Worth a read,"While Jones' take on the second World War is supremely readable in all its forms, including THE THIN RED LINE, he is not, as some would have us believe, the utmost authority on any of the subjects that he undertakes. His basic, journalistic style is commendable considering the subject matter, but while Jones seems to employ it out of necessity Hemingway glorified it as a means to a very desirable end. Jones' use of multiple narrators is interesting, as well, but his catalogue of characters becomes so large that the reader is forced to bookmark the dramatis personae. In this regard, Mailer trumps Jones with THE NAKED AND THE DEAD where many narrators are used and the reader cares about each as an individual. A good book, but Jones is the master neither of his style, nor of his subject matter."
4,Great War Fiction,"I must admit to one thing. I read the first 80 pages and put this down for a while. After a month I picked it up again and was glad I did. Jones tells such a vivid story. He goes from character to character so well, and shows you what they feel, fear, and fantasize about. Yes it is slow, and yes if you saw the movie you might never wish to read this (I read the book long before the movie), however you will not be sorry once you have finished it."
5,A classic of America literature,"Ever wonder what it might be like to be in battle? Here's the story of the men of C-for-Charlie Company. There are no heroes in this book, at least not in any traditional sense. The charcaters created by James Jones are men with the foibles that make each of us what we are. Within pages the reader can smell the sweat of fear. What writing! I read this book when it first came out and only re-read again. It hold up to the test of time. The Thin Red Line is truly compelling American literature."
4,The book is good,"I agree with the other reader of the book it is rather hard to keep up with the names. However, thats what the page with all the names listed on there is for to help you keep a track of who is who. As i started reading the book i simply crossed out the names that were wounded or killed and explained in a footnote what had happen so i could follow the story. The book as a whole will keep you on your toes while you wonder page after page what will happen to the solders under the command of a commander that seems to care for nothing more than a medal. Like for instance sending his troups to do a road-block that was no way possible without a act of god. I would have gave this book a perfect 5 had it not been for the fact that there were so many characters to keep track of. Hopefully the movie will be as good as the book. I haven't seen it yet."
5,"this book is magnificent, gripping and entertaining.",The thin red line is the best WW2 book I have read. The characterizations are superb. The action sequences are absorbing. The deaths of the soldiers are expertly told and quite moving. Jones explains the cynicism and heroism of soldiers brilliantly.
5,The best and the only access to Shakespeare you'll need.,"It's always hard to read Shakespeare,especially if you are a beginner.But this book made it easy for me.Because it mentions all the plays written by Shakespeare,it tells the story of the play,it's sources,and describes the characters of each play.Buy this book if you find any difficulty with Shakespeare.It's a great help."
3,its pastel orange,"yup thats it its not the color i thought it was not happy bout that but it shipped in a good time frame so really no fault to the seller, maybe next time write in the actual color."
2,Buy oem manual,"Save yourself time and money, buy the oem shop manual if available. There are not many specific ""generating sections"" covered and not alot of detail in what is covered. Engine section is ok."
3,small generator manual,This is NOT a book for very small generators as in my case 1800 colman other than that WHAT limited amount of info it has looks at least helpful to a very few brands.
1,Disappointed...,"I was hoping for something that sparked my imagination and gave me a spiritual feeling. What I got was something that left me flat...no spark, just a few things thrown together and printed in a book. I didn't get the feeling that this writer even felt anything when he was writing."
5,Necessary!,"Even as a Solitary Wiccan, I never felt inclined to pray on a daily basis. I believe in the God, and Goddess, and I do ritual, however, I was at a loss on what to say on a daily basis, and this book was my inspiration on praying more often, because I created my sacred space during my lunchtime, and I went back to work rejuvinated.I got to the point that I looked forward to break time at work, so that I can begin my prayers! There are prayers for each occasion, and you can ad-lib, and make your prayers more personal. I really began to cherish my time with the Eternal Parents.Please purchase!"
4,Nice little toy !!!,"I'm quiet happy with that handheld even if the receiver could be better, I guess.But you have a lot of optionals with that tool, I don't think yhat it is worth to buy the Vista CX, you only have an barometric altimeter (you have a digital one in the Legend) and a compass plus."
2,Old Tech .. Poor Performance,"The biggest problem is that the early etrex units (of which this is one) are very low powered. Garmin has upgraded their low end units with an H so you will see the HCx instead of Cx, they are ""higher sensitivity"". They should have just put an L on the Cx, and called it Lower Sensitivity. I've been very disapointed in the quality of the transmission in a car, compared to Magellan and my Garmin GPS V. These are discontinued for a reason, they don't work very well.NOTE: If you want maping, you must spend another $100.00 or so for mapping software (either Topo or Streets). So add that to your expense when looking for a low end Geocaching GPS."
1,Rock hard,"I ordered this chair for a nursery and I am sending it back for several reasons. The chair was has hard has a rock. It was like sitting on the floor. Also the back of the chair came up to just under my shoulders and I am not a tall person. I wanted to be able to lean my head back.The fabric and the look of the chair was very nice, but it was just so uncomfortable."
5,Great Foo Album,I love this album. I'm not a usual Foo Fighters fan but I do love this album a lot. I think you will too.
3,Defeating Copy Protection,"I'm sure this has been said, but needs to be said often. Copy Protection Sucks. Fortunately, this uses the really crappy Suncomm copy protection. To rip this CD, hold the shift key while inserting the CD. If you've already had this disk in your drive, reboot the computer, and reinsert the CD with the shift key down. iTunes imported this into the library just fine."
4,In Your Honor,"Lots of music for your money! Be aware that this is not the typical Foo Fighters music, especially the acoustic side. Still, for avid fans, this is a great CD."
1,Copyright protection warning,"I was looking foreward to purchasing the CD but not now. Thanks for the heads up on the copy protection, and marginalizing of the Foo Fighters and the Mac."
4,Good to hear,"Yea so its good to hear the foofighters back. A long wait for a great album. Cd 1 gets you pumped up,it's everything you suspect and is very well worth the purchase.CD2The foo's are very good when playing accoustic. Friend of a Friend is my fav. The guys really put together a solid a album.Rock is back the way its suppose to be In Your Honor in one word is Solid....... Foos"
1,Could not read copy protected disk!,"I would really have liked to write a review about the music on this CD, but it will not play in my computer or CD player.If the music industry keeps punishing their paying customers like this, there won't be any left."
3,"GREAT CD, but BOO to copy protection","This is by far the best album of 2005 so far, and very high up in the Foo Fighters's list.However, with that said, I BOUGHT the CD today, and in order to play it on my PC, I had to download the songs so I wouldn't have to install their spyware!Boo too the Foos on this one. I want my money back. Once again just goes to show that copy protection only hurts the honest customer. I had NO problem downloading it."
3,not too good,i kind of liked nirvana but after this album I dont like the Foo Fighters. the lead signers voice is annoying. when I first heard DOA on trl I was disappointed. so i picked up the CD for the hell of it and realized it wasn't that good. album of the year? no way. kanye west's late registration or rent is the album of the year. i gave it 3 stars because I liked the second disc but the first one is rocking and the second one is like a pop CD which I think is better then the rock so if you can get this bootleg trynit out but I dont like it.
1,"Copy-protected, come on!","Well, I won`t buy it. I'll just download it, like the criminal the label thinks I am..."
2,General Blahness Throughout,"In my opinion, the only two songs that distinguish themselves from the rest are ""Best Of You"" and ""In Your Honor"". Aside from those two songs, Disc 1 is just a jumble of B-side mild rockers with nothing special to offer. And I have to admit, I haven't listened to Disc 2 all the way through. I keep falling asleep. I fell in love with every previous Foo Fighter album at first listen. But they have nosedived into mediocrity with this album."
5,The Best Yet..,"This by far is the best album put out by the Foo Fighters. I have always listened to their music. Definitely being my #1 favorite band, and this album blows it away. Dave Grohl has an amazing voice and the lyrics are simply amazing. Just an all around great listen and a neccessary add to any CD collection. The 2 CD's was a great idea.. one to rock out to and another for a more mellow mood. Genius in every aspect, the best in my book. A MUST HAVE!!! ..Pick it up soon."
5,Love It,This is my first Foo Fighters CD that I have ever owned. I had bought the new coldplay cd not too long ago and someone told me I would like The Foo Fighters also. They were right. Not a dull moment on this CD and I am going to buy any other ones that are out. If your trying to stay awake in a car or at home this CD will help! It's awesome and it rocks.
5,"Copy Protection, Schlopy protection, but the music is good","My iTunes likes it just fine, imported as 192k MP3.And no, I don't share my music (except in iTunes sharing for others at work). I should have the right to make copies of my music (for instance leave the CD in my car, and listen to my MP3's at home on the iPOD or at work on my PC). I shouldn't need three copies of the album to accomplish this.As soon as you show me a starving music exectuve, I'll change my mind. I'm not trying to *STEAL* anything. I just want to listen to the music I PAID FOR where I want to. The people who are going to steal it, know the way around this anyway!Also, as a side note, why worried about the MP3's when I can make full rippable copies of the DVD side no problem?! At the very least I can listen to the DVD version at home, and leave the CD in my car. But, I'll be leary to buy any more ""COPY PROTECTED"" CD's again from the Music Mafia."
1,Doesn't Matter How Good It Is,"Why not? Well, because I'm never going to buy a copy protected CD. Not that it stops pirates anyway, just people who like their music their way. Sorry Foo Fighters, I might have missed a classic there. Still, your ""revenue is protected"", just another $16 less than it could be..."
2,Alrite,I read in Blender Magzine that Dave Grohl said he took a Shi* on their last album. He should probably do the same with this one. Dave's voice isn't that good. I suggest you skip this one.
4,"Disc 1, Amazing. Disc 2, Ehhhh....","The title of this review basically says it all, in a nutshell. Disc 1 is the REAL CD, as far as I'm concerned. Disc 2 is more of a bonus disc. It's like buying the real CD, then getting an import live CD thrown in with it. Disc 2, the acoustic stuff, is a complete miss for me. I can't get into it at all. Doesn't suit Dave Grohl's voice in the least, and it's actually, extremely boring. I don't mind though, because for my money, I got one of the best Rock CD's of the 21st centuries.Disc 1, the Hard Rock album, is absolutely brilliant. It's the Foo Fighters on a new level. The sound is more mature, and it's just a truly incredible album from start to finish. I didn't think that the Foo's could do any better than ""There is Nothing Left to Lose"", but they might have outdone themselves on this record.Way to go, guys. And, btw, is there any wonder there were no songs released from CD #2? ;)"
2,major dissapointment,"If you loved David Grohl's self titled Foo Fighters, and The Color and the Shape, you will not find this album very entertaining. Disc 1 is the ""Hot"" side, and every track sounds the same as the last. Same goes for the 2nd ""Cold"" disc, which is an attempt at playing acoustic. This is only my opinion, but I listen to the Foo Fighters for their rock/grunge riffs, and the flow of their albums (The Color and the Shape is a great album to listen all the way through, and it feels complete at the end) but In Your Honor has absolutely no flow. Grohl says that this is the best Foo album. Unless you want a pop/arena rock album that goes almost country at the end, you will hate this album. I could barely listen to this one all the way through. What a dissapointment after One By One's awesome comeback."
2,The Foo gets fought...,Copy Protection bad...yada yada yada...unlawful interference with buyer's enjoyment...yada yada yada...decent album from what I hear...yada yada yada...won't buy it...
1,Boycott copy protection,I see no reason why I have to buy music twice - once for my stereo and again for my iPod. I will not do it.
2,Split Personality,"This two CD set is not a CD you should rush out and buy. The first CD is classic Foo Fighter style. The songs are good, solid rock - just what you'd expect from the Foo Fighters. CD two is acoustic. It isn't what you'd expect. It is good to see a band step outside the box and do something new and unexpected. So while I applaud the Foo Fighters for stepping out of the box, I found the second CD completely lame. The songs were unmelodic and uninspiring. There was no punch, no life. If you want solid rockers doing acoustic the right way pick up the last Godsmack CD or take a step back in time about a decade and pick up an acoustic version of Alice in Chains. The verdict here is download the best and forget the rest."
4,"Great Music, bad software","A Lot of complaints about not being able to copy the CD, add to iPod, etc.There's an easy way to get around it, follow ea-pty's advice above, or Google it. I did it, it's easy.Definately a good buy, I loved the contrast between the two discs."
1,Copy Protected CD is NOT good.,"The performance can be great. The Artist phenonomial, but if I can't listen to it. I will never buy it. Music Labels, WAKE UP! Want to sell us music? Then let us BUY it, OWN it, AND play it on ANY device WE choose.If I were the artist, I'd be upset that the music labels were hindering sales and my income by installing copy protection. greedy is the work that comes to mind. After all if the users can't listen to it, Why buy it?Choose wisely where you spend your music dollars."
1,False advertising,"The DRM is a definite issue. If the Foo Fighters had balls, they'd stand up to this sort of crap, but they're typical mainstream artists now. Their music proves it further. The first CD, which is supposed to be hard rocking, is mild at best. Most of the ""hard"" songs are just as soft as their last two albums. As for the songwriting, don't listen to the fanatics. It's average at best."
1,I HATE RCA,"This is probably a good cd, but I use an iPod and RCA is retarted for making it like this, this is not against the cd its against RCA, i bet the cd is very good."
1,defective disc,"This disc is defective. It will not play , and I keep receiving a ""disc is dirty"" message."
1,It realy was not the page turner it promised to be.,"March 1, 2002Scatterpath by Maralys WillsMy overall opinion of the book 1 out of 5 Stars.My opinion of the plot 2 out of 5 because the plot only came in half way through the book.My opinion of how credible the book was 1 out of 5 stars. You would think that the characters in the book would be smarter.The book was to predictabble and not very plausible.At the end of the book I felt like I had wasted my time.There was no part in the book that I really enjoyed."
3,Travelogue doldrums,"I did not enjoy this book as much as others from Mayle, including A Dog's Life and Hotel Pastis. A year in Provence was also better. This one did not flow well and it seemed like I read many chapters that could have come from different books. Read his other books first."
4,Exellent,"This book is charming, funny and heartwarming. I have never read A Year In Provence, but I recomend you do--most people who have read both say you should. It also helps to know some French."
4,Wish I did not get hardback!,This book did not live up to Mayle's first book. It's like he's trying to cash in on that fame.
3,Works ok,"It's a nice product that works ok. Personally, I didn't care for the flavor or the consistency.. It may be good to someone else's taste."
4,The Rod Of Seven Parts-Amazing,"The Rod Of Seven Parts is one of Douglas Niles best pieces of work.It shows the forever prominent struggle between Law and Chaos, and encompasses the story of the main weapon in the fight,a weapon of Pure Law...The Rod Of Seven Parts...The book folows the trail of the hobbits Kip Kayle and Saysi Formilly as they take on a perilous journey to stop the queen of Choas from completing her task of realising Miska,the Warlord Of Choas and her consort...they are Law's only hope..."
4,Jerry Goldsmith delivers an epic soundtrack,"Jerry Goldsmith obviously did his homework for this wonderful score to the movie of ""The Mummy"". Mixing an eastern sound with today's technology, this soundtrack has all of the themes....from desert battles to chase scenes, from horror to love themes, each track is an audio adventure that enhances the movie to its utmost. Goldsmith is right on par with John Williams, Trevor Jones and Wolfgang Korngold. If you need an action-adventure movie scored, these guys are the ones you need."
3,Well Bugger me up a tree backwards,"Jerry Goldsmith has produced a very loud very percussion kind of score which works great with the film but dosn't stand that well on its own.Buy it if you like Goldsmith but don't if you don't like him, there you go."
5,The most substantial score of Goldsmith,"Undoubtedly the most substantial score of Jerry Goldsmith. I enjoyed every single minute! As another amazon reviewer wrote (for another score of his), he has this superb gift that he adds each time a different touch at his scores without having the disadvantage of Zimmer, Williams and Horner, who write almost identical soundtracks. This also happens here. Golsmith composed the absolut eruptive and brilliant music I have ever heard! I loved the action tracks, the Egyptian-romance theme , even the horror moments of this CD. In simple words, this score is just the ideal for this kind of movie! This CD is surely one of my initial choices every time I want to hear some great orchestral music to make my day! Buy it and you won't regret."
5,A beautiful egyptian scenario with old movie flair!,"One of his best pieces contrived with the same intensity as Poltergeist and the 13th Warrior. Definately not to be overlooked. You will be swept into an egyptian tomb as he scores another dark adventurous theme. Feel the wrath of Imhotep while listening to track #8 (personal favorite), The Crypt. Then only to be wrapped up with a great ending, track #15 The Sand Volcano, that consists of different emotional eliments that start out fast and ends in an almost soft romantic melodic tone. All in all I highly recommend this Goldsmith soundtrack...it has a lot of old classic movie flair!"
3,Cat Snuff film,"Graphically it looks amazing. The story however... let's just you spend most of the movie watching things that may or will kill the cats. Oh look they lost 2 kittens to hyenas, now a storm rolls in, NOW A LION ATTACKS, NOW CHEETAHS ATTACK.Seriously, it's a very pretty well narrated cat snuff film. If you like kittens that survive more then 30mins in the movie, skip it. Don't let your kids watch it if they love cats. I swear though the 4th time the cello's started to play and they showed grass waving in the wind I was like I'm done, another main cat is dead."
3,"Sub-Par Dictionary, Great Teaching/Learning Aid","As an ASL student, I was rather disappointed with this book's word coverage. It was rather spotty, showing words such as ""roller skate""(as a verb) but not ""roll"", for example. If you already know ASL and just forgot a word or want to brush up on the language, I don't recommend this book for you.However, this would be a great teaching/learning aid, boasting such features as large and detailed pictures, written directions on how to form a sign, alphabetical word listings, memory aids and context examples on how the word is used. This is great for educators to use as pseudo-textbooks during lessons. However, its poor dictionary coverage will limit its use somewhat."
3,Creative but not user friendly,"My daughter, age 10, got this product today. After laughing about what the other 2 reviewers wrote (and the 5-star review is obviously a joke!) I had to write my own.This is great for a creative child since they can draw or write their own, very small, like the size of my thumb, msg or picture on the button. She did need help twisting the parts together so I don't think it's a product a child can use totally on their own. I super glued some backs on that wouldn't twist together. The ones that aren't glued together I wonder if they'll eventually pop apart. But this IS a toy, and ultimately she had fun using it and making buttons for herself and her friends. It's a so-so for me."
2,"Great idea, shoddy product","The idea of a button maker was attractive for my 5 yr old nephew however this ""toy"" broke the first day we used it. We made less than 10 buttons and although the ones we did make came out ok the maker should have lasted longer. Also, the button size is smaller than a quarter so you are very limited to what you can put onto/into your button. I'd pass on this one."
3,Not much for hiking,I'm sure this book is useful for climbing approaches etc to the different summits in the Indian Peaks Wilderness. Don't buy it if you are looking for meaningful hiking or backpacking information. This is geared for climbers.
3,Terrible Picture quality,"The story line in the book is really good but the photos are very old (sixties or seventies) and re-produced so many times, they're grainy and of poor quality. Just needs to be updated w/ much better photos!"
1,A Ridiculous Volume in a Dreadful Series,"The factual inaccuracies contained in this book and in the others in the series are inexcusable. In addition, the anthropomorphic, sensationalistic style with which the authors portray supposedly ""dangerous"" animals assigns the natural world a false and malicious attitude that simply does not exist. I would reccomend never buying this book or any by these authors, since their factual integrity is clearly quite low. If it were possible to give it zero stars, I would."
3,"Low Calories, but tastes really good","When I first got the product, I was a bit disappointed to realize that it's quite low calorie (50 calories/packet, 4 packets/box, 2 packets = 1 1/2 cups of soup). To me, that means that it doesn't really suffice as a meal, which I was hoping it would sometimes. However, on the upside, it does taste really good. Sometimes it's just what you need. So I consider it a decent product, even though it's so low-calorie it can't be anything close to a real meal."
4,Great price,Great priced 12 (total 48 envelopes) pack box. Almost half of what we pay in the stores. Excellent for traveling.
5,Fantastic,"Love the soup. I've been unable to buy it locally, so I was thrilled that you had it at Amazon. Keep up the great work."
3,Salty and cheap tasting,But hey it's low in calories at least. You'll still end up gaining weight though from all of the salt in this stuff. And my god the chicken is disgusting...
5,"Lipton CupaSoup, Cream of Chicken, 4 Count 2.4 Ounce Boxes (Pa of 12)","I love my Cream of Chicken CupaSoup. My granddaughter also loves it. I bought a shipment and split it with my daughter. Surprisingly enough, my granddaughter liked it as much as I did and my daughter did not get much of it. It is a fast, nutritous snack which can really satisfy a hunger feeling. I also use it for cooking. It is my sincere hope that Lipton does not phase the cupasoup products from of their product line. They already have scratched my favorite one, which was Tomato. It was the absolute best and I would buy it by the case. I can no longer find the products in my grocery store, but am very happy that I can still get them online."
2,Serious Formatting issues Make Reading Difficult,"I haven't finished the book, so I won't discuss the content. However, the story contains newspaper clippings and hand written notes and the font comes out tiny. You can't make these images big enough to read, except on my IPAD. I don't know about newer Kindel models. Mine is over a year old. Still, if you sell it in kindle format, all of it should be readable on any Kindle. But I was a dumbass , as this problem was visible in the sample. I just didn't think these images would be an on-going part of the story. I felt customers should know. So try a sample first."
5,I dare you to read this book!,Are you ready? challenges you to deal honestly with yourself. If you care at all about your future and the future of your children you owe it to yourself to read it. And yes read and re-read it so the bible verses it illustrates can sink into your heart and mind.
4,Bunko artists beware!,"It's the good guys vs. the con men!RACKET SQUAD (with Reed Hadley as Capt. Braddock) ran for three seasons on the CBS-TV network, starting in 1951. A total of 98 half-hour episodes were aired. The show's announcer/narrator was Hugh Beaumont. Guest stars on these four episodes include a former East Side Kid, TV's Lois Lane and a retired heavyweight boxer (once defeated by Joe Louis in 1941).This is a nice sampling of early television crime drama..The following program list includes viewer poll ratings, plus episode number, season, original airdate and guest stars.(7.7) (#31) Accidentally on Purpose (S.2, 1/3/52) - Billy Halop/John Doucette/Archie Twitchell(6.2) (#39) The Case of the Hearse Chasers (S.2, 2/28/52) - Betty Blythe/Jack LaRue(6.6) (#34) Desperate Money (S.2, 1/24/52) - Frank Gerstle/Lou Nova/Raymond Hatton(7.1) (#57) The Long Shot - (S.2, 7/3/52) - Noel Neill/Edward Keane/Helen Spring"
2,Repetitive,You will really like at least one song on this album. You will probably not like hearing that one song thirteen times.
4,Good Stuff.,"This is a quality album with no 'dog' tracks. It's old, but it's stood the test of time. If you're looking for a new copy, you're out of luck unless you get it here or on an auction site. Bryan Duncan's: www.placetobe.org/duncan/"
2,Phoenix USA 377-1 Exterior Shower Box,"I have found better items coming from Amazon. This item looked like it was on a shelf for a long time with all kinds of dust and not properly packaged. There was no directions with it to speak of. If I did not have some abilities of my own it would have not been installed. The item almost looked used but it couldn't have been so I installed it and never looked back. There was no paper work or billing information with the package at all, if I was not the one who ordered it there was no way one could have known who ordered it and for what price. this company needs to be looked into closer by Amazon."
5,Paper Life,"Very interesting book, easy reading but can't put it down once you start, just shows fame isn't everything."
3,Little Girl Lost Grown Woman Found,This was among the most poignant and heartbreaking novel I have ever read. However Tatum should be proud to overcome such a sad childhood to become the strong woman she's today. This novel is a must read. If anything it shows that even in the worst circumstances you can overcome.
5,Tatum,"Hip, Hip, Hooray!!! Thank you Tatum for an excellent book. I hope you produce the movie. Talk about Hollywood coming out of the closet. This was a very moving book, a tell all. The wonderful thing is that this is a book of everyday life of addiction and the effects of addiction on all family members, but coming from Tatum O'Neal makes it a special read. I could not put the book down. Thank you so much for writing this book. I hope the world reads it."
2,What a whiner!,"I grew up loving Tatum O'neal. I feel for her for having such a difficult childhood. However this book is full of her whining and complaining about everything. She does dish the dirt about many hollywood ""has beens"" if that interests you."
1,BORING,"I thought this book was very boring. I forced myself to read up until chapter 7. It definitely did not peak any interest to me. All it was about was how she spent time with Cher or Robert Deniro's wife, the parties she went to and all the celebrities that were there."
4,A Role Model,"Tatum O'Neal takes us through a truly difficult life to date. I greatly admire her fortitude and strength in sharing both the good and bad sides of herself and those around her. That takes a lot of courage. She is certainly a role model for many who have had similar experiences. The book is a good page turner and hard to put down, but a little depressing at times, too, due to the subject matter. Overall, I think it is a well-balanced and well-written account of her life."
4,** Includes a very relevant story about Roman Polanski... **,"Includes a very relevant story on Roman Polanski showing her dirty movies as a child.Very open, compelling read, that made me feel sorry for any child in Hollywood.This is no way for kids to grow up, but its a great cautionary tale."
2,Hmmmm,"I really came to this book with no opinions whatsoever. I didn't know much about her life other than I really enjoyed her in her adolescent movies. After having read the book, I don't even know what to say except that I hear an addict blaming everyone else for their problems. Is it possible that no one at all was ever nice to her? Even the ones that were nice to her, eventually did her wrong??? I was very disappointed in this book and consider it to be very whiny and unbelievable that it actually happened that way. I can see an addict continuously making the wrong choices, but at some point you have to take responsibility for your own life. I find it so hard to believe that her father that was abusive at every turn. I have an addict in my family and I notice similarities and the ""I didn't do it"" attitude."
4,Tight fit!,"These jeans run a little small and the fit is tight....my teen grandsons think it is ""cool""....the grandson I purchased them for could not wear them because they ran a little small, but his younger brother felt really lucky because they fit him.A good buy for young males that have slim frames...not for the more mature male."
4,sticky pad,poor packaging make the product look cheap. Text was poorly written. A translator may have been able to help someone get the text more readable.
5,"awesome, love it, AAAAAAAA+++++++++++++","Sticky Pad for Iphone,black Berry ,Samsung Galaxy ,Etc. awesome, love it, AAAAAAAA+++++++++++++this thing really stick, I use it lot while drive...Great product."
2,sticky pad too sticky,"i purchased 2 and after trying to remove the backing from the first one,I never opened the second. Removing the paper from the back is a nightmare. Instructions do tell you to peel carefully , they just don't tell you how to get it off, in less than a milliion little pieces thus leaving bits of backing all over the back.I am too busy to play with it!!!!Did not work well with my gps. I bought a garmin portable friction mount from Amazon and it is fabulous 5 stars. Did the job ."
2,Disappointed,"I saw these in an office supply store. I had been using Velcro to hold my cell phone. I bought two of these pads. Being brand new I figured they would hold even better right out of the package. I placed it on my dash (you can only place it on a flat part-any slope and stuff falls off)! Well, I wiped off my dash with a dry cloth like it says. It held for a few minutes. I thought, why is this so loose? So I looked at the bottom and it appeared to have some dust particles on it. I wiped the surface again & washed the pad with soap & water to make sure it was clean. Remounting it, I then laid my phone on top of it and headed for a 200 mile trip. With the sun beating down on my dash, the pad became so loose that I ended up placing it on my leather passenger seat (it says don't use on leather! - who has a car that doesn't have leather? I think my dash is vinyl though. Anyway, the sun ruins any stickyness it had and I gave up on it. Back to the Velcro!"
4,"Great for first 500 pages, implausible ending","This was a great book, a real page turner up until the ending. I found the good guys too smart and the bad guys much too stupid at the end. It was all too neat an ending. Nevertheless, there are few better story tellers than Forsyth and this is a great book for a long plane ride or at the beach. In my mind ""Day of the Jackal"", remains his best work by far."
2,MAYBE I'M GROWING OLD...,"This book was a big deception for me... After the marvellous ""Fist of God"", this seemed written in a rush, contrary to all others Forsyth's books (I've read them all). The main character (Jason Monk) seems like a robot and everything seems so easy for him: travelling around the world, infiltrating the Russian Mafia, planning incredible plans. Maybe I didn't get the right spirit to read this book, but it seemed to me, by far, the weakest book by good old Freddie."
3,Not Bad,"This is another exciting book from Mr. Forsyth. He really has a distinctive way a describing the dark beauty of Russia and getting into the heads the Russian every man. The story has a great story line and he peppers the book with interesting sub plots that keep you interested. He has a way a writing a very well thought out exact story that does not leave any loose ends. There was a lot of good, interesting details here - similar to a Clancy book. My only complaint would be the ending, a bit too clean and easy. Overall a good book, if you have liked his other work then you will enjoy this one."
1,"a primitive, if not naive view of Russia","The Russia of this book is ridiculous. The author makes a pathetic attempt to deliver a story charged with ethical scruples, and drawing a sharp childish line between the Good and the Evil: consequently all characters are nothing but puppets, including the puppet masters. Today's Russia is a country very much in trouble, but it is unforgivable to dream, like the author seems to do, that the complexity could be resolved with a few coups de theatre, like restoring the monarchy in the country, or mounting a putsch through ""skillful"" disinformation and manipulation. Don't read it, even if you're stuck in an airport closed because of severe snowstorms."
5,Wonderful mix of fact and fiction!!!,"Forsyth writes an impressive book with an incredible mixture of fact and fiction. I have been to Russia and studied its history and economics; I was very impressed by Forsyth's accurate portrayal of the country. I enjoyed the complex journey from the beginning to the end. Unlike some, I liked the flashbacks and although the ending of the book seemed disapointing to some people, I thought it was fine. It was actually closer to what could possibly happen in reality than what other spy novels usually include. All in all, I thought this was one of the best novels I have read in a very long time."
1,Will I ever get it to work,"I first got the software and try to load it, only to find out that the serial number given, didn't work. I finally did go to there site, and was able to get a new number. Next tried to copy first to harddrive. Had no problem, but when going from harddrive to DVD burner, I have yet, to be able to succeeded there. I have spend time at the web site with no luck, and my next move will be to call support. I did call support on my desk top, and was told of programs provided, to see if the burner was working. I can format and burn to the DVD burner with no problem. So this makes me lean towards that program itself is bad, just like the install serial number."
1,Instant Copy is an Instant .....,This software is unforgiving and full of bugs. I suspect the few who get it to work have a relationship with Pinnacle or other kind of plant. Get error messages copying non-protected sources to DVD and premature disk ejection for VCD. Don't waste your money.Support is non-existent and the manual and help are both of no help. Sounds good but don't bite. YOU WILL BE SORRY.
5,A moving joyride!,"The coming of age story of a musically-inclined Jersey boy in the late 40's, who gets his big break playing his horn at the Crystal Ballroom in Keansburg... and, in the process, discovering the fickle nature of lust and beauty. Told in the prose of a young man, the book channels deep emotions that every adolescent has felt who ever dreamed of grasping the brass ring of his heart's desires. Packed with anecdotes and characters familiar to all, with historically accurate and graphic depictions of life in NJ in 1946. Emotional, funny, and thought provoking, not to mention a compelling read. More than highly recommended!"
2,Not Durable,"This works ok at first. I have Sennheiser MX75 headphones, and it was always a challenge to get the headphones plug to fit through the opening on the armband. I thought this was a minor annoyance. However after only a couple of months using the armband, my iPod would start cutting out randomly and even shut down. I switched back to my old, beat up Marware convertible case, and the problems all went away. I think there was some wicked combination of the poor connection and the armband's tendency to absorb and transfer sweat. I had switched to it to make use of the Nike+ sensor, but it's just not worth it."
2,"Seriously, this could be a lot better","Why would Apple and Nike make an armband where you cannot see the screen? I wonder if that's intentional, however I think that the Nike+ software has an on-screen display while you are running. Also, if I need to re-calibrate or change any settings, I have to take the iPod out of the pouch and try to jam it back in the sweaty armband.Also, the sensor is inaccurate with my Garmin Forerunner 305 GPS watch. I will try to re-calibrate."
2,Not for runners,"This product is good, it doesn't fall from you arm. But the problem that I had with it, is that I couldn;t change the volumen when I was running, and also the wheel click in the armband doesn't match with the one on the ipod 4G. Bad product for runners who want to record every second of their training and know their pace. To stop my training I had to take the ipod nano out of the armband and then press MENU, otherwise I would touch the wrong thing. I end up cutting the wheel click from the armband."
3,Limited Functionality,"I received this armband the other day after ordering for a really low price of $9.99 which I was happy about. Alas, I felt even luckier when I actually went to use it, but not for the right reasons. The viewing window cuts off about 20-30% of my 4GB Nano's screen, even without the Nike+ receiver on the bottom. Also, the functionality of the wheel( being able to rotate it to use the menu interfaces and volume specifically), was almost non-existent save for being able press the middle and play/pause buttons. It serves it's purpose in that it securely holds the Nano to arm and with some comfort. Beyond this, unless it's just me, it's not worth full retail price. Thank god I only payed $10!"
1,Deader?!,"Ok. I am going to attempt some restraint here because i really respect the roots of the franchise but this was ridiculous. never have i seen a more disjointed and pointlessly confusing plot in the medium of film. the directer and writer seem to have taken various pieces of unfinished horror movies and put them all together. the main character was your everyday self-distructive reporter with empowerment issues, and the antagonist(if he can even be considered that) seems to switch personalities every sceen. i would have to say that the most dissapointing thing was that this wasn't even a hellraiser movie. the just shoved the mythos in at the end. the wierd part was that the back of the case made this movie look quite amusing. it sounded like pinhead somehow gets an army of romeroesque zombies and tries to kill the world. sounds like it could make an amazing b-movie. that ""plot summary"" was just a lie. a beautiful lie..."
2,Another One...,"Hellraiser (The first one) is my favorite movie of all time. I have enjoyed all the other sequals (Maybe not Inferno that much, but it was ok). This movie... I don't know. The story was very corny, and i found myself to be bored to often with the movie in general. There are some good scenes in it... But just when it looks like it is going to get good, it doesen't. Lets hope the next one (Hellworld) will be a little better than this."
3,What in the Hellraiser Was That About?,"Well, it seems that Pinhead is back, but takes nearly an hour to show up in this latest opus. I am a real fan of Part One and especially III, the rest really I could care less and this one is one of them. Part ""The Ring"" and part ""Star Wars"" this film borrows more from other films than its own franchise. Still, like Darth Vader, when Pinhead is on screen he IS awesome and makes up for the slow pacing. The film does pull together nicely by the end, but it is a long journey coming. Fans of the series will still find the usual gore galore."
1,Pleaase!,"Absolutely terrible film. When are they going to take the franchise away from these horrible directors and let some one with talent take a crack at it? And, if you don't have the budget to do a good movie, DON'T DO THE MOVIE! The one star rating is for the excellent and entertaining extras, such as the gag reel. Kari Wuhrer tries gamely, but this was a royal stinker. I loved the 2nd and third installments."
3,"Pinhead may be back, but should you watch?","In all fairness its way better then ""Inferno"" for the handful, including myself who watched that one. Interestingly enough, I gave this movie three stars because the story is pretty interesting and not gonna lie...the lead actress is a hottie! But the movie is still the 7 installment in the series so obviously there are flaws in the film...Hell its a direct to video hellraiser flick! But this one holds its own on the grounds that you are always interested in what the hell is going on? The first 15 minutes are pretty intense with a gun shot suicide and a girl found strangled in her underwear in her bathroom.All in all...The movie is not bad, but the flaws (bad acting, what not) are aparent. Pinhead does not even really come into the story until the ending, which is somewhat cool.so...If you find it...pick it up. If you wait a while, don't worry...it will still be here!"
5,These guys are great!,"This recording is truly excellent. The blend, intonation, and variety of repetoire is far superiour to what I've heard from other college a capella groups. As a music major and participant in many vocal ensembles, I was most impressed that these guys do it all themselves. The group is student-run, student-directed, and the songs are student-arranged. But the recording is truly at a professional level."
5,My son loves these!,My son is now 3 years old and still loves to play with this (and all other M&D products similar to this one). It's fun for them to cut the food and also use their imagination. He chewed on them and threw them when he was little and they still look great.
3,a bit dissapointed,"For all the expense that goes into wooden packaging for M&D toys, I wish they would provide lids for their boxes... I always hesitate to buy these toys because I know it's going to be difficult to keep up with the pieces once the shrink wrap is removed. We received this as a gift for my 2-year-old. He seems to like the pieces so far and will sit and play with it for a few minutes at a time, but it remains to be seen how much of an impact this toy will make. I do like the individual pieces (good for counting - later for fractions), but I expected a really amazing toy based on the other reviews. I give it an overall ""meh."" On the plus side, it is lovely and durable."
4,Great toy!,"My 3 year old daughter loves her sushi set. She loves mimicking her daddy eating his sushi. She also is learning new skills with cutting and the chopsticks. She plays with this, her cutting setMelissa & Doug Cutting Food BoxandMelissa & Doug Slice and Bake Cookie Setevery day in her little kitchen.The pieces are well made and colorful. The paint is well done and the pieces are solid wood. And the storage ""Bento"" box is great."
3,"For a small price, a decent Human Torch with a lot of articulation","ToyBiz gave these figures tons of articulation so that's a plus. On the down side are the ""flames"" on his shoulders that look like growths his doctor should check out. He does git in scale with the more modern Marvel Universe figures. So if you want a 3.75"" scale Human Torch and don't feel like spending tons of money, pick this guy up. He comes with accessories, most of which are for whatever game that was associated with these figures. The game cards and the flame missile launcher are pretty much worthless if you don't have the game. He does also come with a little cardboard background of the FF's Baxter Building so some of you might be interested in that. He also comes with a ""flight"" stand which is rather useful. if he is still 9 bucks (after shipping) or so, get him. If he's more than that? Meh."
4,Good tool for the money,"My dad had one of these tools. I remember it as a young boy, about a thousand years ago. It was a little larger with a wooden handle of course as plastics were new, crude and hardly used in quality items back then. Somewhere ago the way, I lost that pre-electric time saver. So I thought I'd get one of these from Amazon. Its surprisingly well made with one glaring design flaw. That is, no built in storage for the included hexbits. Thus, the 4 stars instead of 5. Still okay for the money and I'd buy it again. A word of caution. Unscrewing the handle cap releases a spring that could ""shoot your eye out"". So be wary. You won't do it by accident as a screw driver is necessary. Just be careful."
4,TDOSZ Review,Works on some DVD players but not all. Make sure you have a computer that plays DVD's at least. Otherwise it's anime gold.
3,"Great graphics, but boring story","The graphics is wonderful. All anime should have great graphics like this DVD. However, I personally find the plot too slow and boring. I don't find ""time travel"" too interesting. Kyon is also an annoying character to watch."
1,Xentec HID xenon conversion kit,"XenTec Slim Ballast HID Kit H1 6000K (ultrawhite)The ballast only lasted about 2 months and the bulbs are showing signs of flickering. When switching on the lights and going onto high beam they cause the guages to dip down for a second before returning to normal (speedo and rev counter). I am not happy with these kits. They do make a difference to the lighting while driving, I would reccomend Xenon HID conversions, but not Xentec."
1,"crap product, crap warranty, crap company",Bought this kit for my truck. Ballast gave out after two months. They said they are not replacing it because its after 60 days. Whatever happened to 90 day warranty? I suppose you cant afford a 90 day warranty when your JUNK fails long before that on a consistant basis.
5,Worthy Investment!,Scott explains the material with the voice of someone who knows (beyond a shadow of doubt) what he is talking about. He makes it obvious that he has seen almost every mistake a programmer might make and he offers insight to help avoid pitfalls. Learn about good and bad styles and ideas.Perfect for students with a year or more C++ programming experience who want to take their skills to a deeper level. You should understand class concepts and things like operator overloading and inheritance before you really get the most from this book.Be aware that there is a CD-ROM compilation of this book AND the sequel available for around....
4,Terrific coverage of fundamental C++ techniques,"An absolutely terrific book focusing on basic C++ and object-oriented programming techniques. A crucial book for anyone new to C++ to read.While _Effective C++_ is an important and fundamental part of any C++ programmer's library, truly advanced C++ engineers are likely familiar with most or all of the techniques presented here (dynamic allocation, constructors, basic coding style, etc.). Scott Meyers' second book, _More Effective C++_, covers significantly more advanced techniques which the experienced programmer may not have encountered in everyday code and which may be more instructive. It is only in deference to that book that I have given this one 4 (or, if I could, 4.9) stars."
5,Save years of debugging time!,"Memorize this book and it will take less time than all the wasted hours you spent debugging your C++ code. Read this book to prepare for a job interview, and you will look like a Guru. I have read this book three times, and it is emminently practical for making you a better programmer.The C++ programming language can be characterized as a language that gives you enough rope to hang yourself with. Sometimes I wonder why I program in it at all. But at least this book exists to help you do it right.The only criticism I have seen of the book is the often cited example of using the ""this"" pointer to have an object delete itself. Okay, lots of people don't agree with Mr. Meyers attempt to justify this, but that is a small issue. There is a ton of good advice."
5,This books tells you what the other books do not,Before I read this book I thought that I was pretty knowledgable on C++. Now that I have read it I know that my understanding of the language was fuzzy at best. Meyers presents complex information in a clear and concise manner and he tells you not only what you need to know but why you need to know it. Anyone who plans on programming with C++ should read this book.
4,"Good, low-cost card holder","Item was larger than I expected -- so check the measurements. Also, the SD cards do not grip super snugly in place, so sometimes they fall out when I open the container. But the important thing is that the box is very sturdy, the cards stay in place when it's closed, the container has no problems staying closed, and it's at a great price. All in all, definitely meets my needs."
4,Wonderful but emotionally over the top,"This is a movie for sons who lost their mothers, sons who miss their mothers, mothers who miss their sons or lost a son, or anyone who loves having his/her guts ripped out. It's a extraordinarily well-acted and directed story about a young black mother whose son was taken from her when small. Without giving away the ending, it will leave mothers and lost children sobbing. More than a movie, it's an experience. The theme is the amazing love of mothers for their children. Marvelously done. I gave it four stars rather than five only because it's such an extreme tear-jerker."
3,It's okay,I was looking for a flight jacket and I found one here. It's okay but runs small and looks kind of cheap...
4,"Good jacket, great price!","The jacket I purchased was exactly what I was looking for and the price couldn't be beat. The only problem I experienced was the snap coming off the left side pocket on 2nd wearing. Completely off. Since it was a minor problem, i didn't try and return it, and I hope that it is not an omen of things to come. Shipping was exactly as promised, and the transaction was super! It is a shame it had this minor problem that marred this otherwise great sale."
4,alright....,"decent jacket for the price, my side pocket button came off as well. otherwise it is a very warm and comfortable jacket. a bit bulky but like i said it will keep you warm!!!"
1,for what ?,""" For those who have faith, no explanation is necessary, for those who do not have faith, no explanation will suffice ""Whatever your purpose is for writing the book, you wasted your time."
1,Not Quite Hip,"It's really a shame about the time and reserch that went into this, because the time devoted to this work and the research that went into it are evident and noteworthy. Unfortunately, they're wasted, ruined by the conclusions he arrived at from his analysis, which ruins the book.Hip: The History informs us that singing in blackface is enlightened art, as is robbing bluesmen of the fruits of their labors. Mass Consumerism? You betcha' It's all here, researched, analyzed, and explained.Except it isn't. The arguments justifying inclusion of those acts into Hip's Canon lack the power to compel anyone to accept them. Even by his own definitions and delineated themes, they fail -- miserably.This must be what it is like to be a teacher grading a student's math exam and seeing him following all the proper steps, but getting the answers all wrong: heartbreaking, simply heartbreaking."
5,Very good,"I received this screen from Insight and am very pleased. No dead pixel, image as good as the specs said. I use the screen as monitor for my desktop and laptop. It's very easy to use and the image definition, brightness and crispness is much better than screens i've seen from Cornea, AG or even NEC.The only downside is that it's hard to find and the price is a bit higher."
3,library binded version is small,"When I first looked at this item, I saw the dimensions for the paperback version, which were about 12x9. I wanted hardcover, though, so I selected the ""library binding"" version and did not re-check the dimensions, but I wish I had, because it was only about 5x6. This was frustrating. The price for this version was also almost twice as much as for other similarly-sized hardcover Waldo books."
4,Small book,Please note that this is a small book requiring a magnifying glass (enclosed) to see the pictures. It is not the full sized book like most of the others.
1,Limited appeal,"This book has very limited appeal. I was drawn to the ""home-lover's guide to architecture and design"" part of the title, but a little southwest style goes a long way and just doesn't fit the rest of the United States all that well. I am surprised by how many of my friends went, ""Oh, ick,"" when they saw this on my coffee table."
3,"Hibbert has produced a light-weight, traditionalist overview","In ""Wellington: a Personal History"" author Christopher Hibbert has produced a traditionalist overview of the life of the great Duke. Hibbert rehashes the old ancedotes, and recycles the old hagiographic portrayals of Wellington that have dominated Wellington's historiography since 1815. While Hibbert has indeed provided a well-written and entertaining account of Wellington's accomplishments, he provides no intrepretation of Wellington's actions. For instance, Wellesley's motives for attempting to take over the Egyptian expedition during his sojourn in India is not criticaly discussed. Overall, ""Wellington"" is a popular history that makes no attempt at intrepretation. While, indeed, history buffs who do not have the time or acess to Longford's fine, if traditionalist, account might be well served here, a more serious student should examine Longford's two volume biography."
2,Disappointed -- designs not stylish,I was hoping this book would have cute sweatshirts like the ones I've see at craft shows selling for $40++. There isn't one pattern in this book that I would consider making or wearing.
1,don't judge book by its cover,"This book makes me know why I usually refrain from buying a book that doesn't let me take a peek inside first. While the cover project is intriguing, inside are the simplest of ideas, many poorly executed. Considering this book was published in 2004, it is baffling why the projects are not more in keeping with current design trends in terms of apparel and crafting. Some barely qualify as entry-level projects, and that makes them anything but fashion statements. I feel this book is destined to go to another venue soon -- and I won't miss it."
3,Many Techniques,The pictures and styles were old fashioned looking but there were many different techniques explained in the book. The basic piecing and adding to sweatshirt but also crocheting and other techniques. The cover to me was the most modern sweatshirt.
2,Dated post Apocalypse racial conflict story,"This book passed the time on a couple of long-haul flights recently. Written in 1970, the book definitely shows the mark of time and changes in society. The book's theme is the conflict between blacks and whites which was pretty hot in the 1960s but not nearly so bad now. The concept of a global war between powers based on the colour of the skin doesn't seem too likely today. The book does cover the generic subjects of racial hatred, first contacts with new races, and low tech people meeting high tech people reasonably well. I didn't get many surprises though. The book also suffers from being too short. For example, there is one chapter devoted to the political structure on Mars which could easily have been expanded on to add more depth. Typical charity-shop fare"
1,The company sent the wrong product,"The company sent the wrong product which was a bummer. They sent a big bottle of liquid cleaner - not the wipes. I was on a vacation and had it shipped to my location so instead of returning it, I gave it to a person who wanted for their glasses.So my review at this point is limited to the shipper."
5,Delighted,Each bag makes an entire pot of pu-ehr tea. The flavor is very smooth and rich. Much easier than brewing from loose leaves.
5,BURGESS BOOKS ARE GREAT FOR KIDS,My grandson loved this book. He enjoys many books but this was one he wanted to hear over and over. There are many deer where he lives in Maryland.
1,defective product,"I purchased 3 of these portable door knob guards for our parents home. All worked fine when received and for the first several weeks. But within 6 weeks all of them were toast. At first I thought it had to be the batteries, but replacement batteries did no good. I could see one of these being bad, but all 3! Don't waste your money, at least not on this brand. And it's a shame too because the concept is a good one."
4,"This is a very tight cd, smooth flow and crip lyrics by Mike","This cd is very sweet. A long time fan of the Rap a Lot family, i found that this cd represents it well. Very good. A good follow up Rap a Lot release to the Geto Boys and Yukmouth."
4,1960's version was the best of the three FF cartoon series,"This version was ok, especially if one is an FF fanatic like myself. However, I agree with another reviewer. We want the 1960's cartoon series! It was the best of the three. I cannot decide if the 2nd or the 3rd versions come next. This one here is the 3rd FF cartoon series. As I recall, the 2nd version did not conatin the Torch, as he was replaced by Herbie the Robot. Hence, this version I would probably rate as 2nd best of the three."
4,It is subtitled or dubbed to spanish?,Can anybody say to me if this title is subtitled or dubbed to spanish? Thanks in advance!!
4,Get it for the second season!,"First off, be aware that the first season of this show is AWFUL! Terrible animatation and lackluster action. The actors doing the voices are great though, but the cartoon is still very, very difficult to watch. HOWEVER, the second season is quite terrific! The animation and designs greatly improved, as did the use of the characters' powers, especially Invisible Woman and Mr. Fantastic. The same actors did the voices, but the scripts were much better than the first season. If the first season of this series would have been as high-quality as the second season, this show probably would have lasted longer than it did. I suspect many fans gave up during the dreadful first season."
5,Fantastic Four review,"I am so Glad i bought this item. It is great. I am a big fan of marvel, let alone the fantastic four. I just love how the whole series is within my grasp. It is definitly to the max!!"
1,DOA,Would not sustain a charge for more than 30 seconds under use. Very weak performance for those 30 seconds as well!
1,poor excuse for a makita replacement,"Pwr+ 9.6v Ni-cd 1300mah Makita 9000 9033 192696-2 632007-4 Battery Replacement (Makita Equivalent)I have had Makita cordless drills since they first came on the scene and have never had any problems with their batteries except when they get about five years old they need to be replaced. Now I bought two of these batteries and the old ones I disposed of held a charge better thab these.Don't waste your money on these batteries unless you want too be charging them daily and hourly for they just don't have the power when fully charged.I am stuck with them now but you can bet before my other two ""MAKITA"" batteries which I bought on 2005 die on me I will definately buy two new 'MAKITA"" brand batteries next time these knock off's are a waste of money the $50 dollars I spent could have bought at least one new brand name battery. I am soory to who ever is making these batteries but they are pure junk and a watse of money."
3,Cheap & Functional,"I bought two of these adaptors with the intent of cloning my wife's Thinkpad's hard drive onto a larger drive. The idea being to put both drives in my desktop PC and then running Norton Ghost to clone the original. From a hardware point of view, this worked pretty well, the drives fit easily in the adaptors and the adaptors plugged into the IDE cable normally dedicated to my PC's optical drives (I jumpered one drive as the IDE slave). However, you have to be careful lest you bend the delicate pins projecting both from the drive and the adaptor; it is very easy to remove the adaptor at an angle and bend pins. Be careful.However, although I was able to copy the drive without error, there is something preventing the cloned drive from being used by the ThinkPad; this is not the adaptor's fault. It worked as advertised."
2,disappointing,"I found the book slow and disappointing. The worst part was that so much was written in French that, if I spoke French, I might have understood. They never gave an explanation as to what the French words meant. I didn't like that one bit."
2,"OK, but not great","I felt that this book started out very slow, then once it got going, it was over! The meat of the story happened in the last quarter of the book, which is disappointing. If you have time to read, choose something else."
1,Contrived and Forced,The alleged humor in this book is overrated. The storyline is a summarized retread of many divorce stories floating through our pop culture society. The witticisms and quips that I was promised by many a book club and on-line reading group was woefully minimal. Not even a book I'd recommend for an airplane trip!
4,Dead-on accurate snapshot of clashing cultures.,"This book was just a treat -- as a francophile/-phone and former resident of Paris, I found the characterizations accurate and eminently entertaining. Her perceptions of the French, such as that they never pee and can talk ad nauseam about food preparation, cracked me up. No, the plot wasn't realistic, but I guess that's why they call it fiction. The fact that the characters were either ciphers (Roxy)or caricatures (the expat Americans) made the observations all the more meaningful. And really, antiques dealers in Paris are EXACTLY as she described them!"
1,Am I a snob if I say how inredibly lowbrow this book is?,"If you are a young teenage girl, or a Cosmo magazine devotee you may find this work to have literary merit. However, if you have ever read any books seriously, or have ever been to France or even if you just believe that life and people are actually complicated and interesting and deserve more than tired cliche characterizations than you will agree that this one bites le gran chien!"
4,A Comedy of Errors Leads to Tragedy,"This novel is a take-off on an old-fashioned cross-cultural comedy of manners ofAmericans in Paris. Isabel, a spoiled California girl, goes to France to visit her preg-nant sister, Roxie. Meanwhile, Roxie's husband has left her to go and live with hismistress.The low expressed emotions of the French is countered with the puzzled and 'bar-baric' gaffs of the Americans. A comedy of errors, and ultimately tragedy, ensues.Johnson is a wonderful writer and evoker of moods. For this reason I rated thebook a '4'. However, the characters in this book lack depth and substance. Theyseem to represent and stand for things, rather than existing in their own right."
1,"A laborious, unpleasant read","Confusing tense changes, boring plot, universally unpleasant characters, and foreshadowing that somehow manages to be simultaneously confusing and repetitive. I was all set to quit reading when the suicide attempt got me interested again. But then, lo and behold, everything got back to normal, so quit I did. Who nominated this for the Book Award?"
2,unwanted,In the first three chapters of the book we can see that the author did not include whether the story happens in the real world.It dont make sense to include those stupid characters in the story
5,Bedding for College,"The bedding was exactly what I was looking for to brighten up my dorm, and the quality was excellent."
4,An insightful book.,"I knew very little about DiMaggio beyond his career with the Yankees and marriage to Marilyn Monroe. This book takes a very deep trek into the heart and mind of a man millions of kids and adults alike idolized. The portrait is that of a very exacting, confused, private, frustrated, and frighteningly lonely man. It is proof that ""heroes"" are human too. And that the public never really knows the people we think we know. You don't have to be a baseball fan or a Monroe fan to enjoy learning more about this American icon. Some will like him more, some may like him less, but you'll certainly feel closer to him."
4,Not Exactly An Icon,"This book kind of shatters the image I had of Joe Dimaggio. No doubt he was one of the greatest players in baseball history. But this book gives a real inside look at what drove Joltin' Joe. If you want to remember Dimaggio as the quiet giant of baseball, then don't read this book. It paints a picture of a man driven throughout his life by selfishness and greed all of which seemed to get worse as he grew older. The author definitely did his homework and the insight is remarkable."
2,why did we need this book????,DIMAGGIO WAS AND IS MY HERO---- NOT A HERO IN THE SENSE THAT MY FATHER WAS MY HERO- THE SENSE THAT MY TEACHERS WERE MY HEROES BUT HE WAS OUR BASEBALL HERO---WE WANTED TO HIT LIKE DIMAGGIO-WE WANTED TO RUN LIKE DIMAGGIO-WE WANTED TO FIELD LIKE DIMAGGIO--- WHY DID WE HAVE TO READ THAT DIMAGGIO WAS GREEDY AND WHEN GIVEN A NEW CAR DID NOT SAYS THANKS BUT WANTED TO KNOW IF IT WAS FILLED WITH GAS---- WHY DID WE HAVE TO READ THAT DIMAGGIO SOLD HIS WORLD SERIES RINGS-WHY DID WE HAVE TO KNOW THAT DIMAGGIO BEAT HIS WIVES-IGNORED HIS BROTHERS AND SON---WHY INDEED---- WE HAVE SO FEW HEROES WHY DID RICHARD BEN CRAMER DO THIS TO DIMAGGIO- WHY DID HE DO IT TO US---INDEED WHY---- PERHAPS HE DID IT FOR THE MONEY????
5,"Joe dimaggio, the greatest",This is a solid and Nice interesting book that tells the life of Joe D. up until he died. Very Nice.
4,Fact v. Fiction,"While The Hero's Life is an excellent book about one of the three best baseball players who have ever lived, you have to wonder how much is true. Mr Cramer does list many sources and is wonderful at telling the story of Joe DiMaggio's life. DiMaggio kept the people whom he did not want in his life out and probably for good reason. The question does linger however that since he is basing most of the book on second hand information how much is true. An excellent book that was hard to put down I have recomended it many people. Having never seen Joe DiMaggio play and him seemingly in secrecy for most of his life I found him to be an ""interesting"" person. He was, is and should always be an American Icon; bringing a country that was embattled in war together for a brief point in history. If you dont know anything about Joe DiMaggio but would like to, this book is a must."
5,A Must for the Jazz Drummer,"I'm simply going to reinforce what you may have heard elsewhere: this is as good a foundational text on jazz and bop drumming as you can find (along with Ed Soph's and Jim Chapin's books).If you are interested in learning to PLAY jazz and bop on the drums, this book takes you from a level assuming some knowledge of the drum kit, little knowledge of jazz, and brings the two together in a very logical way.I have milked four years (so far, many more to go) out of this book with regards to the density, depth and entertainment/interest-level of the material."
3,"like the lite, but the clamp","I like the light, but the clamp component is small and doesn't stay tight. When trying to swing the arm, the whole clamp swings sometimes. I think it was overpriced for the clamp trouble I have had. For the money spent, I expected it all to work well. Also, the clamp size is limited to slender table tops. It's unstable if it's open wide. I wished I would have just gotten a table top model as this has proved to be a bit annoying."
2,not as claimed,"I want a light that will clamp onto my desk with out having to drill holes. This light does not clamp on, it must be attached with a drill and screws. To further my disappointment, I have not been able to reach anyone at Amazon to arrange an exchange or at Lite Source.So my lighting problem has not been solved."
3,"OK, but not as good as the first",The Shakira remixes are not as good as the originals but the Portugese versions are just as good. The remixes give a more up-beat rhythm.
1,A Book for Teenagers,"This little book has a promising title and it does tell of places reputed to be haunted. However, most, if not all, of the stories are told in other volumes and in better depth. The author only briefly mentions some haunted places that could have been better researched. She tends to throw out little ""teasers"" and leaves the reader wanting to know more information than is given.As a student of the paranormal, I was disappointed in the quality of several of the photos. One would expect them to be a little more clear. She included some in the back that are purported to be ""ghosts"" They are very blurry and one cannot see much. I tried to see the ""ghosts"" she was saying are in the photographs but to be honest, I couldn't.This booklet may find an audience in teenagers."
5,Gripping and entertaining,"This author has a way of telling a ghost story that makes you carefully read each gripping page of this book cover to cover. I couldn't put this one down! Janice Oberding is an expert writer and story teller. This book is very well written and I would highly recommend it to everyone, you won't be sorry you bought it. Even if you don't believe in ghosts this book is very entertaining and rich in Nevada history, it keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for the next exciting ghostly tale."
1,How to lose readers and alienate everybody,"This book is just not funny. The british are renowned for their wit but maybe being in NY too long dulled this in Toby Young. I ended up despising the author as a snivelling weasel who fails in life by his own lack of integrity and intelligence and belittles his friends and collegues whether they deserve it or not. I finished the book only to see if it improved but alas, no.The name dropping anecdotes are worse than a boring gossip column. The most redeeming feature of this boring and trite book is being able to put it down and thank any diety you can pray to that you are not like the author."
2,True to the title,"Toby Young alienated me in no time. The book is one huge whine-fest about his lack of success in the New York publishing world. He seemed to attribute his failures to the uptight careerists in publishing and the fact the days of Dorothy Parker and Robert Benchley are over (which is why he's so unappreciated). Well, I've got news for Mr. Young: his writing and wit bears little similarity to Parker's or Benchley's. In fact, the only similarity he showed to these true wits was in his alcohol consumption.In short, it's a dreary, unenlightening (and unenlightened) read sure to make one cranky."
2,You can't feel sorry for the guy.,"He does it all to himself. As I read this, I figured that I would somehow identify with Toby and see his foray into the magazine world as a realist going into a self-stroking, cynical environment. I was figuring he was just the wrong guy for the wrong job. Well, not true.He's a journalist. Granted, he's a British journalist (I did learn a few new colloquialisms reading this) going to an American magazine...but he's a journalist and he should have known. I.e., you would not take a job at Company Y if EVERYONE around you said it's not a good place to work.Either way, he digs his own grave. His failure to play the game is what does him in. Quite frankly, his boss tells him to do things, he disobeys, and he wonders why everyone get's peeved at him.Geee, I wonder why?A decent read. If you're in the publishing industry it might be a little more relevant. A decent read, just not what I expected."
5,"Easy, very funny and surprisingly accurate","This book is laugh out loud funny and as an ex-pat Brit, a surprisingly accurate account of how different our cultures can really be. Patently, I am not a journalist but at any level, moving to America presents a minefield of opportunities to upset peers, friends and employers alike. Toby Young has managed to pull off a rare coup. His book is great, the anecdotes are funny, the characters are interesting and I believe, for the most part, accurately depicted and yet you still turn the last page and think, what an irritating little man he must really be. Toby Young is the impish smart ass we all knew at school only he never quite grew up. As for the numerous negative American reviews I have read, I have to believe that much of the disapproving press is more jingoistic pride than rational critique, with every word you write you add rationale to the stance that Young has taken in the book."
4,"If you like Ugly Betty, read this!","Reading Toby Young is not a smooth ride, you come up against some overdone phrasing that is tiresome to wade through. But those moments do pass quickly and if you persevere through those blips, you will be rewarded with wonderful anecdotes and amusing characterization of the fashion and society print media, at times hilarious in their criticism and snobbishness toward the rest of humanity especially as they are some of the most unattractive and socially inept people in New York City (which many of their readers never realize until they encounter them at some party or children's function or other at which time the reader wonders, how they ever got to where they did). I've been enjoying this book as I do a box of chocolates - in small doses - each moment very satisfying."
4,Good Support,"Very good support although the elastic strap is not the greatest in keeping it in place. In spite of that, I have 4 of them for both my wife and I in both of our vehicles."
2,Cracks in the veneer & unstained wood areas,"The table had a nice shape and size, but the workmanship had some problems. The circular section of wood (below the horizontal table top surface) appeared to have a wooden veneer applied to it. There are two (2) areas where the veneer appeared to have cracked apart and showed a non-stained wood that is a light color and is very noticeable next to the dark mahogany color of the rest of the table. In the lower section, there is a triangular, horizontal plate that the bottom legs bolt/screw through is not stained one vertical area near the corner where legs fit into. It is a very noticeable spot because of the light colored wood next to the mahogany stained wood sections.The seller company did refund my money after I contacted them with the problems and returned the table."
4,Rock On!,"This is a classic case of a picture is worth a thousand words. Each person you see has a story that you come up with in your own mind. My particular favorite is the guy with the tee shirt that says, ""Chicks dig scrawny white guys."" It's also impressive to think that may of the ladies spent lots of time to make themselves look the way they appear in the book. Not so much for the guys. Some ink, torn up jeans, Marlboro Reds and a torn concert tee and you're ready to rock."
3,Review for Marrying Up,"This book was an excellent reading choice. I liked the writer's versatile writing style,and would recommend this book.I did not know it at the time of ordering,that I had previously read it,but the content is such,that you would enjoy reading it again."
3,I'm not saying I'm a golddigger but.......,"Paris is a woman with a family known for marrying with money. The Montagues are middle class hard working people who believe a woman should marry a man that is ""established"". Paris is secretly dating her lover Tyson who doesn't fit the family expectations. Paris meets Jabari whom her mother thinks is perfect for her daughter.....but Paris thinks there is something very shady about him.This book was an okay read. The characters needed a little bit more development but the story line was great. I am curious to know what happens to Paris' cousin Alexis and her fiancee Walter...hopefully Ms.Foxx will pen their story.....This book was a quick read and I look forward to reading many more novels by Ms.Foxx.Renaissance BookClub"
3,Reviewer of neck sports,The neck brace was very easily adjusted to fit someone's neck vertically but the width around the neck was not it overlaps. For the price it was far superior to the rest. However my issue is a result of cancer of the spine and the brace cannot comfortably support the weight of my head falling forward.
4,Lighthearted and Clever,A set of a Latin telenovela serves as a container for the absudity of the lives and dramas of the actors. It has a film-school satire visual feel that is refreshing and there several precious lines and hilarious situations. Tatiana Astengo plays a cute as a button naive maid and steals the show in my opinion.Spanish with optional English subtitles.
3,"Heavy going, but sometimes worth it","Having read some Robert Graves before, and knowing his style to be wordy and information dense, I expected this book to be somewhat heavy going, but it was even more tangled than I thought. It is by no means a book one can pick up and browse through at leisure, finding interesting tidbits along the way. Graves himself admitted to having written it in a Muse-induced fervour, and he does seem to dwell a long time on the subject of psychadelic mushrooms...However, if there are specific items you wish to look up in the index, it can provide a wealth of information on, for instance, the Irish tree alphabet (Oghm), and the properties of each tree, or on the paga/wiccan calendar, though he gives the christian names to some of the festivals, and doens't always get the dates right.All in all it is a good buy, very informaiton dense, but definately not for the faint-hearted, or those wanting a quick synopsis on the subject."
1,He doesn't back up any of his hypotheses,"If you want a true book on Celtic myth and not some made up, undocumented treatise of some guys imagination then do NOT buy this book. Buy The Gaelic Otherworld, or the Carmina Gadelica, or Irish Bardic Poetry by Bergin. Buy anything but this book because you WON'T find the truth that you're seeking in it's pages."
4,Fish Auto Feeder,"This is a good feeder. However, it is too small for my fish one seek feeding. It is also difficult to adjust to the amount I want. Oh well, I will use it when I will be on vacation next time hopefully mt fish will have some food instead of go fasting. If you have about 6 koy fish, I recommend the bigger feeder."
5,New Blade Stopped Leaking - Works Great!,"My mother-in-law had a high-quality blender, that she's had for awhile, but everyone of her blades was leaking slightly, and not through the rubber seals. Everytime she would blend something, the liquid would somehow find its way through the shaft, and there would be a black oily liquid leaking through. We ordered her this new blade and ti worked perfectly, and no more leaking."
1,Absolute Garbage,"What a total piece of junk! Don't waste your time with this camera. We got one as a Christmas present, it quickly went in the trash. It turns on and takes pictures fine. When you turn it off, it doesn't turn back on. You have to remove the batteries and reinstall them to get it to turn on again. If you just leave it in the drawer, it drains the batteries so you also have to replace them the next time you want to use it. Never got around to actually downloading the pictures, we just threw it away."
1,Wish I would have read reviews first,"Bought this for our 6 year old birthday Nov 2010; had to purchase memory card separately (which was not clearly indicated on the packaging) and then it stopped working - the ""capture picture"" button stopped functioning - 4 months later.Crayola web-site was no help in finding how to get it repaired or replaced, so we just tossed it. I expected (and thus paid) so much more from/ for Crayola.Buy the $12 camera - it will last just as long."
1,Waste of money,Although the camera had the reputable Crayola name as was sold by a reputable retailer the camera turned out to be a complete disappointment. The software and camera would not work with Windows XP and I could not download the pictures. Customer service consisted of endless music and no one to help.
4,It'll get your feet tapping!,"I recently bought this album and really like it. Really strong and smart songwriting, musicianship, and great depth and varietyof the songs. With driving country-rock beats, catchy melodies, and somewhat irreverent working class lyrics- this collection ofsongs really pack a punch!"
4,Refreshing to hear Hanson again,"You have to experience Hanson live and in an acoustic setting to fully appreciate their talent. They trade off each other's instruments, each playing no less than three. And of course, their harmonies are breathtaking.The new album is full of sweet pop songs that the guys wrote as a threesome a few years ago. This could be pose as a problem, because I'm sure they have written better material since. Although a few tunes seem a bit lackluster and unoriginal, there are gems.Biggest standouts on the new album are:The haunting melody of the title track, which has Eagles influenced touches and vocal arrangements.Broken Angel, Zac's emotional piano ballad, will surprise the heck out of everyone. The guy is brilliant, and could give Elton John competition.Crazy/Beautiful, an insanely catchy Kenny Loggins type of jingle with a bouncy rhythm. You'll be pressing repeat on this one, I'm sure."
5,WOW!,"Who are these guys? Definitely not the guys the old record label tried to mold. Excellent CD! The best music I have heard since Paul McCartney or Led Zepplin. Hanson shows creativity, diversity and extreme talent in this well recorded, thought out and produced CD! They mix a group of songs that range from there catchy pop to serious rhythm & blues to rock. ""Penny & Me"" there obvious single release contains there old pop sound with a more mature sound, but I think songs like R&B ""Hey"", U2 sounding ""Crazy Beautiful"" and Rock ""Get Up and Go"" will be songs people will appreciate. The only thing I don't understand is the 13th track and the long empty space in between music?You must take a listen to this CD, it is so diverse there is music on here for different tastes!"
3,Icy Sparks,"For english class we had to pick out a book to read and do project on it. Well I, chose ""Icy Sparks"" because it sounded interesting. You see the book is about this 10yr. old girl who has violent tics and uncontrollable cursing, symptoms of Tourette Sydrome. At 10, she gets put into one of those hospital for sick kids to at least try and help her with her problem. She gets out, and her illness goes undiagnosed till her adult hood. Everyone in her little town all try and give their opinion's what's wrong with her, as she grows up she matures into a successful young girl and controls her tics and cursing. Icy Sparks is very good book, and if your gonna do like book report you should read this book.M. Vega 17 Orlando, FL"
2,Disappointing,"I just did not believe the story. While I enjoyed some of the use of language, overall I was very disappointed."
2,Unfortunately Flat and Disappointing,"Our book group chose to read ""Icy Sparks"" due to it's being an Oprah choice, and the reviews I had read made me look forward to this book. Not far into it, though, I found it very disappointing and one-dimensional. Although some parts are satisfying (her relationship with her grandparents), numerous characters are totally one-dimensional and unrealistic. The plot starts and stops at times, going nowhere. Her stay at the mental hospital seemed pointless. The end of the book sees her suddenly get religious, solving everything. I think this is most likely due to inexperience on the part of the author. Yet, she does seem to have promise in that her writing can flow very nicely and her descriptions at times are lovely."
2,Our Discussion Group's thoughts...,"We were sadly disappointed in the weak, over-used one-dimensional characters who apparently had to be either nicey-nice or the vile and wicked in order to rate a mention in this story. We were likewise disappointed in the story line which made us feel that the author thought that coming from the Kentucky ""hollers"" or having hill country innocence (like the grandmother and grandfather) was almost criminal, instead of the circumstance that many found themselves in. While we never regret reading any book, it was difficult to find something good to say about this one. We did, however, came up with the fact that this book clearly shows that any town can be made up of lot's of very ""different"" people which in it's own way makes us all ""normal""."
2,Disappointing,"What started off as a good premise, never fullfilled its potential. We ever feel the experience, just get a narration of the main character's life. The relationship between the young girl and her grandparents makes a pleasant tale but certainly not a compeling one. The manifestations of Tourette Syndrome are never clearly detailed. The book gives the impression that the disorder comes and goes (especially when convenient for the plot of the book). Perhaps the author make a mistake writing in the first person, as the young girl. How can the reader feel and understand the emotions of the characters when the narrater is only able to relay events with minimal emotion. The ending of the book was especially disappointing and I took it as an easy way out. Beware...just because a book is in Oprah's Book Club does not make it good."
5,WOW! A 3 DAY READ!,"What a great book! What more can I say??? I read the book in 3 days, which for me is fast! I couldnt put it down! Anyone who has ever felt like an outcast for any reason, can relate to the characters in this story. Icy is a wonderfully bright, and intriguing character! Gwyn...an excellent book about triumph over adversity."
3,Liked it but wouldn't read it again.,"I liked the book Icy Sparks but it's not something that I would read again. The story was good but it wasn't very exciting. At a lot of points in the book it really dragged and I had to force my way through it. Though I enjoyed it, it's really not the type of book I'm interested in, which is why I probably didn't like it much. I don't regret reading it though, because I think it taught me a lot about people and how they deal with things that make them different. It also taught me how people use their problems to make them stronger.I can't recommend this book as something I really enjoyed, but it's really not a bad book to read."
3,Icy Sparks,"I admit it; I tend to gravitate towards the Oprah books. I've enjoyed most of them except for Jewel and Icy Sparks. They weren't so bad that I couldn't get through them; they just didn't motivate me to cruise through them in one sitting. I didn't care for the quirky Southern elements in the stories and the characters.White Oleander, on the other hand, was really fascinating. I would read that one again in a heartbeat."
1,"Flat, Bland and Forgettable","I was very excited about reading this book as I was intrigued about how the author would protray a Tourette's syndrome sufferer. After 300 pages of bland dialogue and transparent characters, I do not know any more about the disease than I did before. Rubio's descriptions on Icy's tics are very thin and mainly consist in her using the phares, ""Croak"" repeatedly. She does not make us feel the true impact of the condition or allow is to understand what it is like to be a sufferer.All the characters in this book are such predictable sterotypes--the kind grandparents, the sympathetic nurse, the mean school children. Even the other patients in the hospital have been seen before in many different guises.Having recently moved from the South, I was looking forward to reading a novel set in rural Kentuky, but this portrays so little of the personality of the region that it could be set anywhere. All in all, a very disappointing read and I wish I had saved my time and my money."
3,I loved Icy,"I really liked this book, and I am fairly easily ""bored"" with some books, and am definately turned off by saccharine stories. I listened to the audio version, and never felt as though it was moving too slowly. I enjoyed all of the narrative. My 9 and 13 year old girls liked it very much also (although I fast-forwarded through the section where Icy and PeeVee have their conflict). When I listen to the tape on the way to work, Icy stays with me all day. I would recommend it to anyone interested in coming-of-age stories with a twist."
3,quick read,"I enjoyed the story, but found the writing style a little boring/predictable. I also thought the timing varied too much, making it difficult to follow -- at first, chapter after chapter of one season, then suddenly skipping years between chapters, without cluing the reader in explicitly. I was also not a fan of the end, which I won't spoil here, but it felt contrived."
3,Hmmmmm.,"Thought I would give this book a try, you usually can't go wrong with an Oprah's Book Club pick. But while it kept my interest, it felt like a lot of the store was missing. Characters didn't have a lot of depth."
2,Ending bad...,Decent book - not really gripping - I didn't fall in love with any of the characters...so I didn't really care about getting through it. (Just fyi - I'm a 29 year old female)...but the ending just ruined it for me...I was really hoping for something interesting...but the last three chapers warped into this huge religious freakshow...all of a sudden...they're all bible beating their way to the end...and then the epilogue was just stuck there...with no continuity. I wish I could return the book...I guess I'll donate it to the library...blech.
4,replaces Casio strap,"I've had this for a few days so far. Fairly easy to install, seems about as durable as the original Casio strap (i.e. it should last for a few years and then break, just as all my Casio straps have). It's a good match for the Casio watch. Good thing it came with spring bars, since this watch has solid non-spring bars. One oddity - the strap is slightly wider than the inside of the buckle, so it's a bit hard to pull through."
3,Functional. Annoying.,Tag doesn't fit through the buckle very well making it more difficult to put on and adjust than necessary.The band is much thinner than OEM so I don't expect it to last as long as the original; we'll see.
5,Excellent Transaction!,"Everything about this transaction was smooth. Thank you for a product in great condition, speedy service and shipping. My kids are going to be thrilled with this Xmas gift."
1,RIP OFF - DRM makes this title unplayable,"This *was* an awesome DVD. I purchased it some time ago and got the 2 disc version with the WMV HD (high def) release. I watched it on my PC and it was truly amazing.. but now a year or so later and a new PC, it no longer works. You put the DVD in, and it tries to validate at syncast.com, which no longer exists! The DVD can not be viewed without the flippin DRM validation! WHAT A RIP OFF!!!!! I am so p*ssed off - they could at least provide some way of removing the validation requirement, but noooo, too greedy and too unethical to do that. This is why I refuse to buy any software with DRM that requires activation or limited installs. No wonder these companies are being sued."
3,decent stoke,"Perhaps the fact that I was really looking forward to this film biased me ahead of time, but I was dissappointed. Its a fine showcase of surfing, surfers, and surfculture. But its not the visionary, creative, b-e-a-utiful celebration of one of the world's most glorious sports that it could be. It doesn't quite find its voice as it cuts back and forth from documentary to meditation, from factual discussion to subjective reverie. And the soundtrack, while nice, is also more a choppy, cross-current white-water than it is unifying wave. A good 'see', but not a must own. Not for this surfer anyway."
4,Worth the watch!,"It was worth the watch! It had some awesome moments in it & some touching moments of the human element.I rode my first wave on a 12"" yatch swell in Bouge Sound, N.C.on a Hanson Doyle 50/50. I think I was 11 or 12 years old, the board was about 10' ??? & took two of us to carry as it was like a barge that took very little to ride. I rode waves up to 1980 & gave up when I moved to South Florida as it was not the same as North Carolina & it's 5 to 6 foot waves spawned in the Fall. The wind would blow from the southwest at maybe 15 to 25 mph all day on the shores of Atlantic Beach & then a cold front move in exactly in the early AM & blow lightly from the northeast. THAT made some AWESOME glass.Thats what this movie reminds me of... the things that we love about surfing!Bill"
5,Beutifull and fun,"This movie is fun, and has beautiful scenery. It's maybe not for the hard core surfer looking to watch competition surfing, but I would say it is a must see for any surfer or even beach lover."
1,step into...nothing,"the HD version requires a license that is only valid for USA and Canada...and I made the mistake of living in Portugal!I'm been trying over and over (and over)xN again to get it but...zip!be carefull! don't let your entusiasm for HD video fool you!these guys from ARTISAN are very ""professional""..."
5,Bryson doesn't disappoint.,"The author of A Short History of Nearly Everything and A Walk In the Woods didn't disappoint me in his book on Australia. You will learn more about Australia than you ever thought you would want to know. Bryson delivers information about the continent down below in an entertaining way. As I do with most of his books, I laughed out loud on more than one occasion. I especially love how he can't wait to get a beer in every new town he visits."
4,In a Sunburned Country,"An hilarious, laugh-out-loud, mascara-running-down-the-cheeks, homesick-making read. I (along with at least six fellow passengers en-route to LA, recently) thoroughly enjoyed every sunburnt, red-dust, blue-bottle-filled page of this book - gross exaggerations and all - once I had recovered from my confusion and disappointment regarding the misquote on the very first page - Dorothea MacKellar wrote 'Of droughts and flooding rains' not 'flooding plains', but I'm sure you've already been reprimanded a thousand times, Bill. Blame your proof-readers. Obviously, they weren't Aussies."
4,Kangaroo Kute,"Bryson continues his travel odysseys with his Quest in finding the Quirks and Quaints on our planets only island-country-continent with historical anecdotes along-the-way makes for a pleasant visional journey. His explanation of the ""right-hand-turn"" traffic laws in Melbourne brought back the mother lode of remembrance to this writer of that beautiful city and country."
4,a very entrtaining read,"I gave this book a big rating for a number of reasons, firstly as an American Bill writes with a turn of phrase more like an English writer which I really enjoyed, then as an Australian who has visited most of the places he wrote about I found it a very humorous read, his description of all the dangerous creatures that could do you harm had me laughing out loud, of course they exist but no-one ever allows them to limit their enjoyment of the outdoor activities. I found the interesting facts about the multitude and diversity of ancient fossils that abound in the remote areas of this amazing country. Finally, I would like to thank Bill for hours of enjoyment having read most of his very entertaining books."
4,A new World,What struck me most about this tale was the fact that it told of a totally different world than I knew about. We all know of Melbourne and Syndey. But Bryson traveled deep into Australia at Alice Springs and to the western corner at PErth and north into Darwin.These were areas that I was totally unaware of. It gave me such a greater appreciate for the entire country and continent
2,Mr. Bryson's least funny book.,"I'm a huge Bill Bryson fan, so I preordered his latest book and was pretty disappointed. The research, as always, is meticulous, but there wasn't one page that had any big roaring laughs on it, which is what makes his other books such standouts among travel literature. No weird encounters with sheep shearers or people at laundrymats or anything. I really felt that Mr. Bryson was just plodding through a pretty boring writing assignment--either that, or he has truly become very middle-aged. Next time, I hope he brings along Steve Katz or maybe one of his own children to lighten things up again. Read this book if you want to learn a lot about Australia's explorers, Aborigines, minerals, plant and animal life, but if you want to really have fun, read any of his other travel books instead."
5,A great book about Australia!,I would highly recommend this book. I found it very interesting.I'd give it more stars if I could.
4,Excellent travel book,"A really talented writer brings a very personal view to his travel through Australia. Easy to read with lots of explorations of out-of the-way places that I nw have on my ""must see"" list."
4,Australia thru the eyes of Bill Bryson,First off I'd like to say that Bill Bryson is a very humorous and talented writer. In a Sunburned Country is full of Bryson's humorous anectdotes and fluid --entertaining writing style. The book is certainly worth purchasing just for the laughs it provides and the opportunity to experience Australia thru the eyes of a real travel pro.The only criticism I have of the book is that sometimes I feel that Bryson is making some of his unique encounters up--or embellishing his anecdotes and stories with a good dose of bullocks. But whatever his methods--I must admit that I loved the book and it has paved the way for me to make additional purchases of Bryson's travel books.
4,"Better than Cold Fire, not as good as Street Magic.","I really liked this. It was darker than a lot of T.P.'s other books, but it was better than Cold Fire or, in a way, Magic Steps, because the student, Kethlun Warder, was much more realistic, in ways. Well, maybe that's the wrong word. He was more human-seeming. I also didn't like, in other books, the way T.P. made them so well suited to the tasks set for them. In this, it's not Tris who's suited to the tasks, it's Kethlun. That seems more appropriate, in a way."
2,Incredibly boring,"I purchased this book to help me write a term paper on female serial killers for grad school. I was very disappointed, there was little to no mention of female murderers whatsoever. How can you not include this??? It is a feminist book, which is fine by me, but I wish it delved more into the psyche of various female offenders."
3,Beginners? I Don't Think So!,"I just started playing piano again after a 20-year break, and I'm kind of stunned by another reviewer's comment that a beginner can play these songs. I found this book really hard for me because it requires playing lots of sharps and flats. When I played some of these songs years ago, I don't remember playing all these sharps and flats. I sure wish I could play this music, however, because this book has pretty much every song you would possibly want to play. Oh well, maybe in 10 more years. :)"
2,Far more difficult than advertised,"This is in no way and ""Easy"" book. Has nearly full score sheet music style writing for the advanced intermediate player. Key signatures with as many as six flats in some songs. Original intros and lyrics are nice but anyone who buys this needs to be an experienced player. Good selections and I am disappointed that I can only play a small number of them in spite of having had a couple of years of lessons and several years of playing for my own enjoyment."
3,Read at your own risk,An excellent second book in the Marquis de Sade vampire horror series. But the author wastes no time filling the reader in on much of the history from the first book. So its a bit like coming into a nighttime soap in the second year of the series. I would strongly suggest that readers buy and read Sips of Blood first before cracking the cover on this one. Ms Mitchell lets her characters drive the story. For that reason I liked the first book better. Some of the most fascinating charaters were left behind. This story centered on the least enjoyable pair a father and son in a life long struggle of love and hate seasoned with guilt. Sade was entertaining as ever. His attempt to Henry Higgins the new inexperienced vampire was very interesting. The book ends with nothing but loose ends nothing resolved and so many possiblities that I can't wait for book three.
3,Desert Sessions volume 9 and 10,This was a gift for my stepson. I guess he is satisfied with it since he asked for it specifically.
2,Track Titles,1. Rock 'n Roll Preacher 2. You Ask Me Why 3. Evermore 4. Quiet Hour 5. Everybody Knows for Sure 6. Galilee 7. Tinagera 8. Lay Your Burden Down 9. Slow Down 10. Sometimes Alleluia
4,Good cd,"I like ""Glow in the Dark"" and ""Spirit Wind"" better. But this one is very good. Great last three songs, and the early songs are catchy.""Talk to Chuck"" for copies of his other albums."
5,School Book,"The book came in fast and I was in possession of it before fall classes started. It was a new book so there is no need to comment on the condition. In my opinion, Amazon always does a good job. I have been doing frequent business with them for three years now, and they have never disappointed me yet. Thanks Amazon"
3,Good basic comparisons but too much Christian pontification.,The book gives the basic facts but the buyer should be warned that the religions of the world are all bounced off the Christian perspective. You should know this is coming lest you set yourself up thinking you'll be getting objectivity.
3,Boxed set only for 4th movie in english ?,"I think it's a little devious of the production and marketing divisions to only release Inuyasha, The Movie 4 - Fire on the Mystic Island .. in English ... as part of this boxed set. I own all 3 previous movies, and just wanted to get the 4th one in English dub.Figures... can only get Inuyasha, The Movie 4 - Fire on the Mystic Island in english as part of this box set.That's sooooo wrong."
4,Movies,The Inuyasha movies have some of the best animation in them. The movies are very well written and acted. My favorite one is the Swords of the honorable ruler.
4,A New Jack Swing Fans Dream,"New Jack's Lance, Dre, and T-Bone mixed some the funkiest R&B, new jack swing the early '90s had ever seen (some say courtesy of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis). The stylish, dancing quintet (adopting some style from Kwame and Tony Toni Tone) had all the tools to be successful, and it showed when ""Attention: The Shawanda Story,"" ""I Got a Thang 4 Ya!,"" ""Sweet On U,"" and ""Hey There Pretty Lady,"" were released as singles. The group hit it big when the new jack classic ""I Got a Thang Ya!,"" hit no. 1 on the R&B charts, and broke the top-20 on the billboard hot 100; the track is sexy, Aaron Hall type vocals, with a memorable hook. The hit single is not the only track that makes any type of impression on Lo-Key's debut album."
3,WHERE DEY AT?,VERY GOOD CD ONLY WISH THE GROUP WOULD HAVE STAYED TOGETHER AND MADE SOME MORE POWERFUL MUSIC. JUST LIKE THEIR ALBUM SAYS WHERE DEY AT?
2,Lapse of Reason? Too right!,"Oh dear! Ok so 'Signs of Life', 'Learning to Fly', 'On the turning Away' and 'Sorrow' are pretty good. That's only 4 songs though (and one of those is an instrumental)!'A new Machine' (parts 1 and 2) is just filler; plain and simple. 'One slip' could have been better if the words weren't so rubbish ('a restless eye across a weary room' indeed!), 'Yet another movie' should have been called 'Yet another song' and don't even get me started on 'Dogs of War' - the worst Pink Floyd song EVER - by a long way! 'Terminal Frost' sounds good at times, but also sounds like it belongs on someone else's album!You'd do better buying ""Delicate sound of thunder"" than buying this - most of the tracks feature on that album too. Floyd after Waters have done 2 ok albums: ""Delicate sound of thunder"" and ""The division Bell"" - AMLOR is NOT one of them!"
2,For The Love of Dave Gilmour...,"I gave this a listen. It is little more than another of Gilmour's boring solo albums. It's pretty sad when one of the better guitarists has to fool the public by using a prestige name in order to get his solo album heard. Furthermore, this album is atrociously boring.He shouldn't use the name Pink Floyd (and neither should any other former member of the band for that matter). Two stars out of kindness to Gilmour but what a gyp!"
4,THIS IS GOOD!!!,"""learning to fly"" has some real strong lyrics and ""on the turning away"" is beautiful. I think that this album is totally different from the other albums that I heard. Although I do agree that Gilmour has shifted slightly towards the ""pop"" side......overall this album is a winner!!!"
3,Too 80s,"I consider this the Floyd's worst album. No, this is not because I'm pi**ed off about Waters not being in the band. I'm glad that Gilmour decided to continue without him. Good for him. Waters was way too overbearing in the later years. And after all, it was Waters' idea to go on without Syd, just as it was David's to go on without Roger. Tit for tat. I simply don't like this album because of the 80s feel to it. The 80s was the worst decade for rock music, undoubtably--and this record shows it. There are also too many mediocre tracks on it. I do like ""Signs of Life"" and ""Yet Another Movie"" (the most Floydian tracks on the album). The two ""New Machine"" songs are pretty cool, too. As far as post-Waters Pink Floyd albums go, The Division Bell is far superior, though."
2,I love Dark Side of the moon and the The Wall but...,But I do not like this CD nor do I like Animals
3,Should have been a David Gilmour album.,"Maybe I'm not giving the number of stars it deserves....perhaps if this album was a David Gilmour album...it would get five stars plus. Songs like ""On the Turning Away"" (which is my favourite song on the album) is just not a classic ""Pink Floyd"" song.The only two songs that would be consider ""Floyd"" songs would be ""Signs of Life"" and ""Sorrow"". What was desperately missing in this album was the musical contributions of Richard Wright, who did not make any contributions (in terms of song writing) after the WYWH album until the 1994 album Division Bell (which is much better than this album).As an album, this is one of the ""must haves"". But as a classic ""Pink Floyd"" album, you might want to make this one of your last albums to add to your collection."
5,Not 100% the same 95% the same as the original 1987,"This Pink Floyd 2011 remaster is just a bit fuller in bass warmth than the original from 1987 and like all of the 2011 Pink Floyd remasters there is an ever so slight treble rolloff which in the case of A Momentary Lapse of Reason makes it sound less digital, more refreshing. Drink up."
1,"Gag, hack, cough","Voting only to give it one star and to dilute the four stars it currently has. This album is an absolute piece of crap and anyone with any musical sense would throw it out the window along with their media (CD or cassette) player for being tainted by this bland, vanilla, and sickening commercial use of the name ""Pink Floyd""."
2,Lame...Not even good music for the 80s!,"This is the worst Pink Floyd album. Learning To Fly is good, Sorrow is okay, One Slip and Yet Another Movie/Round And Around are tolerable, On The Turning Away is lame, Signs Of Life and The Dogs Of War are totally pointless, and I won't even say anything about A Lame Machine (Part I) and An Even More Lame Machine (Part II)...too late. If you are a diehard fan, you know that you have to get this eventually, but don't waste your money if you're a casual listener. It's not even good for 80s music - that says a alot. Usually I try to write about the good things in albums, but it's near impossible to do with this. AMLOR should have been calle A Complete Lapse Of Coolness...yeah - take that. I don't know, maybe I'm a little hard on David Gilmour and gang here - no...nope. If you're wanting some later Floyd, then The Division Bell is what you want. AMLOR is kind of an un-good version of TDB."
3,wears down halfway through,"This album starts off good but fades at least in my opinion. ""learning to fly"" ""one slip"" and ""on the turning away"" are all good but the album fades slowly after that. The saxophone solo's dont go well and it end up sounding corny. I listen to this album still due to the first few songs espicially one slip. ( was it love or being in love)"
2,"What is this, Genisus?!!","Guilmour cant write, I admit Learning to Fly is good, and ON the Turning Away is a treat, but the rest of this is crap. Dogs of War is Guilmour's horrible attempt at topping Waters songs on the Final Cut (floyds best album). It sounds like Genisus, posibly the worst classic rock band ever. I don't care what anyone says, this was not Pink Floyd. Although the title does fit it well if you think about it."
2,Pink Floyd? Where?,I like the work that gilmour has made. Really! I hope you like too. But to use the pink floyd's name in a albun like that... The New Machine (part I and II) it's a prove that gilmour rumour and egoim. There's nothing to suggest the Pink Floyd sound.
5,Super,"This is a super album, it has traditions but is's modern too. Gilmour knows, what the word ""music in the 80's"" means."
1,There's only one word to describe this album: PATHETIC!,"This is just David Gilmour another solo album, hidden under Pink Floyd name, so it would sell. No lyrics come close to Rogers (which is a great lyricist) and even the melodies aren't Floydian. This is not the sound of Pink Floyd. I mean if both the music and the lyrics are awful then it isn't Pink Floyd! Sorry David, but you should start doing somthing else than lyricwriting (and don't let your wife help you, because she isn't even good in it). David is a good guitarist and it's a shame that he can't write better music on his own. Don't buy this CD but if you want something after Roger, Devision Bell is better, because some of the songs are listenable."
3,"Good, not great","I am a huge Pink Floyd fan. Though I like some tracks like learning to fly, the entire album sound feels a little tired and synthetic. Lyrically it feels a bit prissy and commercial at times (it's like a polished facsimile of earlier PF works). The 'contemporary feel' that others talk about is precisely what I don't like about this album.I give it 3 stars out of 5."
3,Babble Ball Animal,"I was disappointed because my Yorkiepoo who loves toys that make noise, nosed it around for just a few minutes and has ignored it since."
3,A bit misleading,"The camera works as advertised, but I find the advertisement(s) to be a hint misleading. I wanted to set the camera up, have it buffer the images locally, and I would then plug it back into my router at the end of the day and review the images.1. The camera requires a network connection to boot up/initialize. Since it's not wireless, that means a wired connection to a router must be present at all times in order for the camera to operate.2. The onboard cache of the camera is tiny, so storing images locally is not a viable option anyway.So, again, the camera works as advertised and perhaps I simply purchased the wrong tool for the job. However, when they wrote that no local computer was necessary, I mistakenly assumed that (also) meant no constantly connected network. I'm off to buy a (much longer) Cat5/6 network cable."
2,confusing internet setup,"i wanted a camera that could email photos but this camera will not go out through the router and the manual setup , to punch a hole thru router is confusing."
1,DO NOT BUY Motion detection does not work!,"Generates video with 3 second stills. Motion detection generates hundreds of blank files along with the ones that have motion. The setup of the camera went pretty quick. The web site setup went smoothly.The product is useless. Software in the camera does not work and/or is poorly designed. It will not buffer images. Motion detection does not have a hot zone. Client viewing software motion detection places hundreds of small null files in the directory. Every 10 seconds. So there is no good way to quickly view motion files. Video files are in proprietary format so you cannot view them without going to their software. The software is crippled, but you cannot buy an uncrippled version. Are you serious that you could actually ship software this bad with a product. It's worse than a joke. I'll never trust the brand again."
2,Good Camera - Lacks SSL,"This camera was easy to set up without the need of the set up disc. All you need is a web browser (see other reviews). You should note that if the camera's ability to send e-mails is important to you, it does NOT support SSL. Most e-mail providers now require SSL to be able to send e-mail, so if your does, this camera will not work for you. I returned the camera."
2,can't make it work correctly,"The camera is very nice, and was easy to install and be able to view on my home computer. However, it is supposed to be able to be viewed over the internet from other computers or from internet enabled cell phones. I have spent hours trying to make it work. I downloaded manuals for the camera, for my router and anything else I could think of. I emailed Panasonic, Verizon, and the camera web service and nothing has worked, so I have given up."
4,Good bang for the buck!,"Pretty dang good quality for $85.00. You can afford to buy multiple cameras later down the road at this price. Unfortunately, the DVR software that comes with the camera will not export a compressed MPEG video unless you purchase it for $350.00. All recordings will remain locally on your hard drive."
2,Not recommended for Mac users,I could only use this camera when hard wired to my computer. This camera has a feature which allows you to view it on the web. I could not get that to work as well as the wireless function. I returned it and got the D-Link 930 and had it up and running wireless and on the web with my Mac very quickly.
5,WORKS BETTER THAN EXPECTED,"This is an EASY cheap way to check in on your baby/sitter. FORGET it if your a mac user. I have two macs and 1 PC on my network, after an hour reading the Mac directions here I gave up. Took 5 minutes to set it up with the cd on the PC. After set up YES you can see it online, log in online anywhere to see it, even tried on an iphone. The night time feature is not so hot so I set up a small 15 watt light in the baby's room and it was a-ok :) I purchased a 2nd camera and it does not want to go live online, have to give panasonic a call to see what's what. The free service they give is awesome for going live online but I'm not sure if you can use it with multiple cameras. I have to say it was worth every penny when you look at what some of these cameras can cost."
2,Poorly Done Science overview,"Despite a few good shots - repeated again and again -this made-for-TV show treats the viewer like a youngster with Alzheimers, continually using the tricks of ""stay tuned for the really hot scene"" before what is an obvious commercial break, followed by the usual recap of where the progam was before the break. The science is superficial, and fails to cover essential details, such as the precession of the moon, whether the planets precess, how metals and heavy elements coagulated discretely in the crust of the earth permitting mining, etc., when the Earth was formed in a molten state and the heavy elements like Iron sank to the core. Credibility is hurt by factual errors, such as showing a Boeing 747 as the Air Force One that carried President Reagan to Japan, when his plane was actually a 707. Not worth the money to purchase - rent it and forget it. Better, wait for the BBC to produce the definitive series."
3,"Up-to-date information, Good for Seventh Grade Schools","It's nice to know the latest count for the moons around Saturn and Jupiter and other later breaking space news, but as is common conclusion here, nothing really heavy otherwise. The 'flash-bang-whiz' aproach is good for junior high school classes and illustrations to explain things are fitting but distractingly numerous. My biggest disapointments; all of the many probes Nasa and others has sent out, why are these shows about 98% computer animated? Yes, the graphics are pretty but why not more real genuine photos? Why is it when planets or meteors crash they explode like they are made of TNT? Or when you pass a planet there is a sound of engine thrusters? Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy the programs and will get the up-coming blu-ray sets, I'm just not used to science being presented in an ""MTV"" fashion. The BBC aproach is best and most dignified."
3,Y el idioma extranjero??,"El aÃ±o pasado compre la primera temporada del el Universo. AquÃ­ mismo en Amazon. Resulta que la ediciÃ³n era pobrÃ­sima, anunciaba que traÃ­a subtÃ­tulos en espaÃ±ol, y por eso la compre.La serie me parece muy buena, en especial para acercar al publico general a estos temas, claro si queremos algo sÃºper especÃ­fico como se lee n un review anterior no es lo mejor.ComprarÃ­a a ojos cerrados esta ediciÃ³n en Blu-Ray, pero lamentablemente no trae ni idioma ni subtÃ­tulos en espaÃ±ol, aquÃ­ en Chile la dan por History Channel y lamentablemente no en HD."
2,Astronomy for the Lowest Common Denominator,"Why is it that the rest of the world (BBC anyone?) seems to make science programming that challenges and educates the mind, but over here, science-related programming is targeted at children and poorly-informed adults?Watching this, I couldn't help but ""reverse-engineer"" the History channel's perspective of its target audience. I deduce they regard us as slack-jawed buffoons, too focused on ""American Idol"" to have the patience to sit through a real science show.As a result, this show talks down to the audience with drivel such as ""That's a big explosion; you don't want to be anywhere near that thing when it goes off.""If you have any knowledge whatsoever about the solar system, Season One will be tedious to sit through (the wider Universe is not covered in depth in Season 1).The video quality does not seem to be in true blu-ray quality either. Perhaps they figure we'd be too dim to notice."
4,Greater Than Angels,Greater Than Angels is a great book.It takes place during the fall of 1940.Anna Hirsch and her family and friends are Jews and they get deported from Germany to France by the Nazis.They are put in a refugee camp in Gurs.Anna and other younger children are aranged to go to Le Chambon.Rudi and Klara which are two of Anna friends live with her at a Swiss Red Cross home.Rudi gets it arraged for Klara and Anna to go to Switzerland .When Anna and Klara are getting on the train.Anna and Rudi realize they have feelings for each other.This is a powerful book that is very sad but also very funny.I hope you like it.
2,...,"I didnt really like this book cuz like it was so confusing, it kept on going back and forth between flashbacks, and its not very intresting either. LOL Normally i would'nt even read a historical fiction novel but like we had to cuz we were doing this historical fiction thing in our class...Anyways I thought this book was pretty bad, but if you like historical fiction then this book might be a good pick for you."
4,Important Young Adult Book,"This book tells about Le Chambon, a town that is not oftendiscussed. The people of the town were righteous Christiansand not nearly recognized enough."
4,slasher flick?,i'm not sure whether or not this movie would exactally be considered a slaher film. it seems that way to me. others seem to disagree but i thougt the whole bank robbery thing was interesting it added something real to what would have been just another horror movie. also unlike the majority of movies like halloween you got to see the victims or mary at least being stabbed usually you just get the flash of the knife and then see a bloody corpse so i liked that but i have one major concern here that pretty much prevented me from giving this 5 stars.. where the f**k was the nudity?
3,"Movie packaging is cool, unfortunately movie is a bit dull.","I figured I'd pay the $10 (from Amazon seller) to see this flick because of the cool packaging and synopsis. It'll look good on my shelf. It was decently made for a lower budget film, it's just your typical, non-gory slasher film. You always knew what was goona happen. No inventive kills or anything. Kinda cool references to good horror movies. 2 1/2 stars."
1,Malevolence,I love horror movies but this is not one I would even recommend to some one to spend the time to watch..
5,I will wear this perfume until I can no longer find it,"I have worn this perfume since it came out in 1982. I have allergies and am very sensitive to perfumes, most give me headaches. This perfume works for me. It is subtle and smells fantastic. Thanks for the prompt service.MCS"
5,Gorgeous author!,"I have been a faithful Hooters restaurant'regular' since 1992, and I must say this book really captures Hooters in its full glory. The pictures are hot...and April is a goddess. (...)I found her humor to be exactly in line with what goes on at Hooters. At least the 32 locations I've been to. We all love Hooters,the girls, and the food (...)!"
4,insightful chronicle of a young man's struggle with life,"i really like this CD. it follows the young man, probably and autobigraphical account of ben fold's earlier years, with passion and insight. complex lyrics and mellow tones add to the indecision and struggle ""reinhold"" faces as he goes through his later adolescent years. it is slower and softer then their previous works, but holds together with clever words and ben folds five's signature quirky outlook on life."
3,a little disapointing,"This cd is marginal at best. I liked the first few tracks on the cd, but after that it all kind of sounds the same. There arent any instrumental 'hooks' or riffs like on 'Full Collapse' - which is what got me into the band to begin with. The lyrics are pretty cool, and the cd has its good moments. Overall I was disapointed with this cd and would recommend ""Full Collapse"" over this cd if you are looking for a Thursday album.www.jhombi.comwww.purevolume.com/jhombi"
2,Boring.,"Not much to say except extremely dissapointing. Full Collapse was an auspicious debut - forceful and well-written - with a voice all its own. The new album though, is boring. There are no songs with the same build or power as something like ""Paris in Flames,"" the urgency seems to be gone and the writing is dull and pretentious. Not one song on the album matches up to the better songs on Full Collapse, not one.Hopefully this will be a sophomore slump."
1,God-awful,"When I first heard ""War all the Time"", I thought it was a joke. A whiney little tin voice trying to have a range, mopey little lyrics and wailing, it must be a joke, right? Unfortunately, no. It's a whole CD of mopey gross manic-depression ""emo"" shlock that makes you want to puke if you're over the age of 14."
4,PART 4 OF THE COMPLETE OVERVIEW,"Die hard fans will like this part four of the complete overview of the EGYPTIAN born singer.While not as vintage as the first three,VOYAGES et RENCONTRES still has some wonderful songs like BAHIA,GASPARD,J'AI VU DES ROIS SERVILES et L'HOMME AU COEUR BLESSÃ‰.MOUSTAKI is a traveller(un voyageur devant l'Ã©ternel),he has visited many places all over the world.The main thing about this collection is collaboration;all these songs were written with many friends of GEORGES.He actually presents them himself in the booklet.The first three cds had songs written and composed by him.The four cds are also available all together."
4,All you ever wanted to know about Wodehouse,"Perhaps only we diehard wodehouse fans will enjoy the book but for us it's a treasure chest. For the first time I understand why Bertie Wooster loathed Christopher Robbin so. Milne their author, attacked Wodehouse viciously for broadcasting from Germany during WW11.Wodehouse's parents denied him first love and then a university education. I would have liked to know how they reacted to his success as a writer. McCrum never mentions it.The author made a few mistakes in describing the stories but considering Wodenhouse's massive output that's understandable."
5,GI Joe Light Strike LSV,"This is a great vehicle for any serious GI Joe fan, from the collector to the youngster. It is close to accurate in detail and easily customizable to whatever your favorite mission might be, yet durable enough to be fun for the most active kids that simply want to run it all over the house and yard. This is definitely one of the best vehicles on the market for 1:6 scale soldiers and gets a high recommendation from me."
2,Was this the first draft?,"This book must have been the author's first attempt at writing a book. The book is poorly written. The author saw a way to get something in print about est and to make some money. This book should have never gone to print. I gave it two stars since you may gain an insight or two from this book but the sheer pain of trying to read this book is not worth the time. This is not due to the Landmark/est lingo but is due to the poor writing style of the author.If you are looking for a book to provide some insights similar to Landmark Forum or the est training purchase the out of print book ""The Book of Est."" The book of est is written from the viewpoint of a person attending the est training."
1,Dont buy this,This volume had to be returned as it contains only the first third of the book as written. There was nothing in the promotional literature that indicated this would be a curtailed version of this public domain classic.
2,Disappointing,"This book is misnamed. Its supposed to be for professionals, yet it contains exactly the same overly-general advice in all of her pet-owner books. At one point, in the discussion on aggression, she states that if the dog is really out of hand the reader should seek the help of the professional! Duh!I've enjoyed and learned from Ms Benjamin's books over the years, but found nothing new in this one - its all recycled material. And way too vague to be truly useful to the advanced trainer, much less the professional."
1,"Violent, aggressive approach to training","There are better ways to train dogs and other animals that do not advocate ""stringing the dog up"" by the neck when it misbehaves. When I read this in what is a widely acclaimed book, I removed it from my recommended reading list. This jerk and puke method of training is outdated and ineffective. Operant conditioning is the way to go for long-lasting results that does not cause your dog to fear you. For dogs with an aggression problem, do NOT use Benjamin's methods or you will likely get bit!"
1,Could have been Better,"If you have a aggressive dog who is over 10 pounds and need some seriouse help or advice, I would advise purchasing another book, this trainers advice for everything was grab the dog by the collar and shake it while saying NO NO NO. I have read better books.."
3,A good cookie but the orange taste is too strong,"While Nana's makes generally excellent cookies, this particular formula is quite strange. The orange zest flavor is incredibly strong and it has oddly crunchy rice-like bits in it that aren't great. I'm sure that there are probably fans of this recipe out there, but I wouldn't order it again."
1,So disappointing!,"This sad confection is a perfect example of why you shouldn't do your grocery shopping while you're hungry. It was a total impulse buy and i was REALLY excited about it. No eggs? No dairy? Hooray a cookie for vegans like me! It sounded perfect. When i got home and took a bite i was SO disappointed. There's hardly any lemon flavor to it and it sucked all the moisture out of my mouth. It was like trying to swallow paste. I tried a few more bites to give it a fair chance ... but wound up throwing the majority of the cookie in the trash.Unfortunately, i paid over $2 for this darn atrocity. Ah well... lesson learned."
3,"Ok, but a grainy texture.","It's definitely lemony, and nicely sweet. However, it's very high in fat and has a pronounced grainy texture. I found that when I keep them in the fridge, they taste better than at room temperature.I'd probably try her other cookies instead of buying these again."
3,tasty but...,"These are tasty, however, as per the nutrition info on the package, one serving is 1/2 a cookie! The calories for half a cookie are 140 and the fat for that half a cookie is 5 grams. So if you eat the whole thing it is 280 calories and 10 grams of fat!"
3,meh,"I respect the idea behind these cookies, but the taste and texture leaves something to be desired, at least for me. Dry and powdery would be how I describe these. Not horrible, but I've tasted better gluten/nut/dairy free cookies than these."
4,It tastes like a brownie,I was surprised at the intensity of the chocolate flavor in this cookie.It is slightly drier than some of the other Nana's cookies I've tried. Probably because it's loaded with cocoa powder!
2,NOTE that WHEAT-FREE does NOT equal GLUTEN-FREE,"Nana's No Wheat - No Refined Sugar - Chocolate Chip Cookie, 3.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)I have tried several of Nana's products and they are VERY, VERY tasty for the occasional snack or special occasion. With my gluten-free diet (and expecting family members with dietary restrictions), I ordered a box of these renowned Chocolate Chip Cookies for inclusion on the dessert table at my son's graduation BBQ.PLEASE NOTE: these ""No Wheat"" cookies DO CONTAIN GLUTEN--in the form of barley flour and malted barley. In my ignorance, I excitedly purchased these without carefully reading the ingredients. WHY would these cookies be advertised as being free of Wheat, Sugar and Dairy, and yet, contaminated with Barley??? Yes, they are, indeed ""wheat-free""... If someone can explain this, I would love to hear the explanation. Consume these with caution."
1,Fantasy,"Mr. Wohlberg spiritualizes the Bible. We must choose to either take God at His Word (literally) or to spiritualize his words into myths that fit our fantasies. The author takes the Calvinist position on end times, calling the Church ""Israel"", telling us the rapture will not happen, that we're living in the millineum now, and that the Jewish Temple will never be rebuilt. Such vast contradiction of the Scriptures is thankfully rare.We must be very careful to compare what men tell us with what God says in the Bible. That's not hard to do and protects us from delusional men who would have us put our faith in them 'instead of' God."
4,"Great shampoo, shelf is not very durable","I LOVE this brand of shampoo, partic. the basic formula. It lasts easily as long as a standard liquid bottle. Environmentally friendly, no petrochemical bottle, but wrapped in paper. Shipping's more efficient because you're not shipping the liquid only the dry shampoo. It feels great on your hair. A little problematic to travel. Not a liquid per TSA, but can be sloppy. Or get big plastic ""dry case"" , work ok.The shelf worked great for a year or two. Keeps bar dry, lasts longer. The box is cheap, needs a coat of varnish/laquer- it gets mold on it. The case has broken apart in this time because it's so thin."
4,Opera duets---beautiful in bites,"I ordered this album after hearing a cut on public radio--the beautiful performance of ""Viens, Mallika"" from Delibes' Lakme.I also was delighted by the Humperdinck selection from Hansel Und Gretel. The voices are wonderfully complementary. But for me, a bit of high-pitched singing goes a long way. Listening to this album in one sitting was less pleasant than listening to a couple of selections at a time. The beauty stands out in small doses. True opera aficionados might prefer the full-length overdose."
3,Average Police Drama,"Well this will be short, but this is by no means a bad show. But being a huge fan of NYPD Blue, and Third Watch, i just feel like Brooklyn South is not as good as either one of them. I dont think the acting is all that good, nor do i think that the plots are all that good. But its still an interesting show worth the watch, if your a fan of Police Dramas"
1,Illisible.,"Ne pas acheter ce produit si vous voulez lire un livre en franais. La traduction a Ã©tÃ© fait par un ordinateur ou du mot Ã  mot.... je me demande bien si un livre lisible en franais existe pour le kindle... je suis plus que dÃ©ue! 10 dollars de perdu.extrait: ... Mais sa mort, qui est devenu dix ans avant son propre, produit une grande modification dans sa maison; pour fournir sa perte,il a invitÃ© et reu dans sa maison de la famille de son neveu...Vous voyez?"
4,fantasy,"A wonderful story of bridei, a young boy who is left with a special teacher to train him. But he doesnt know he is being trained for a prophecy rather than a specific job. This book is about the innocence of bridei, as he grows up, what he goes through, what he is supposed to be looking ahead for. This book gets you in for the next two books of bridei's special prophecy. As always there is a girl involved, but she come into the story much, much later, actually it takes quite a while to get to this part....dont be put off just yet. The book lightens up after the little girl is added to the story and of course she is not part of the worlds prophecy but maybe part of the fae's doing to help the prophecy. I hate to give a good story away but read it and find out what you think."
5,Magical...,"I love Juliet Marillier's work. When I found out she was starting a new series, I eagerly counted the days until its release. The Dark Mirror is not only an incredible story, it's captivating. I couldn't stop reading it. I am now counting down the days until the next book in the series is released."
2,I finally stopped at page 360...,"At this point I just did not care any more about the characters. As someone else said, the book was just drowning in details - it could have been shortened by at least 150 pages. But I wanted to like this book because I loved the Sevenwaters Trilogy. Too bad there is no comparison.I kept waiting for a nice romance to develop but this angle was horribly written and a little too incestuous for my taste - I mean they were raised together in the same house, etc. -- way to like siblings for my taste. Oh well."
2,Mystery Inc.,"show takes some getting used to, but seriously, why doesn't WB just release the entire 1st season instead of these ""volumes""? this volume includes the first four episodes."
2,I have a large closet....,"But this bag had to be removed. It is very long, wide and sturdy. If your closet can accomodate a garment bag of reasonable quality, that Can hold multiple garments, consider purchasing this. I bought (2) and can't use them. Maybe the the kids could use them....hmmmm"
4,eager solver,"We have used this dictionary for many years. Our late edition was so beaten up, we wanted to have a new booklet. We like this dictionary for the many famous names, the many informations on different countries (including the US) and the informations on sports teams."
4,Crossword dictionary,"I've tried other dictionaries but none can compare with this one. I had an older version of this book which was getting very dog-earred so I decided to get a new version. I don't think it has been updated as much as it could be, though -- my old book with a 1995 copyright seems to be exactly the same [which is why I didn't rate it higher]."
3,Dell Crossword Dictionary 21st Century,I was disappointed in this version and I liked the old version better. I used my old one so much it fell apart and that is why I ordered the new one. The old one had twice as many words and was very helpful. This one is just ok.
1,The Crow - Wicked Prayer,"An ok chapter of the Crow, I only watched it once and probably never again. Edward Furlong (Terminator 2) is not mysterious enough to play the part. If you are into the Crow watch it if not do not bother."
3,Crow movies mixed into one...,"All in all, this movie did not reach out and grab me like the Crow movies of old. It fails to produce a feeling of realism....too much sex talk, too little action...Looking forward to the next one, if there is one..."
2,City of Angels was better then this,"When i crow fan(such as myself)says that city of angels is better then this then there is a BIG problem.theres just so much wrong with movie let me see if i can sort through it all.first the love between the main characters feels so fake,like they have no feeling.second the bad guys SUCK,especially tara reid and david borrianez.he over acted so much at the end it was laughable and reid is just a horrible actrees to begin with.edward ferlong as the crow wasnt too bad but couldve been better,i mean why was he always lerching?the action and revenge kills werent all that great either.all in all this movie should have been ALOT better then it turned out but i give it 2 stars cause it is a crow movie after all and at least edward ferlong was better then vincent perez in city of angels"
3,Dissapointing,"I bought Vol. I & II and was not that impressed with the selections. The audio was OK. I am comparing these to an old Album, now out of print, White Boy Blues which I liked much better. Understand that I'm not a musicologist or expert so this review is basically I like it or not. I'll probably see if I can trade them at my local music shop."
1,A little bottle goes no where,I have many Philosophy products and have been overall very happy with the quality and value. This one disappointed miserably. I am a nursing student and wash my hands often. This handcream doesn't go very far at all and I was out by the end of the second day. Washed right off too so if you wash your hands a lot like I do this one's not for you.
1,Save your money!,At the beginning of this book the author states that Honduras is the only logical choice for living in Central America. He bases his view only on the low cost of living and not the quality of life. Costa Rica is more expensive than Honduras but has better infrastructure and the quality of life. The weather is also superior in Costa Rica.
4,The Prophecy - Forsaken,"In my opinion, this is one of the best of the five,""Prophecy,"" movies.Tony Todd, does an excellent job (Equal to that of Christopher Walkens) in his portrayal of a deceitful, evil, angel not yet kicked out of heaven!All of the,""Prophecy movies,"" not only show the power of angelic beings, but that they are not the cute cherubs that we see on hallmark cards.all of the ""Prophecies,"" DVDs are well worth seeing, and very entertaining."
4,"Disaster-If anything will go wrong, it will.","The Enterprise is damaged and everyone is separated. As attempts to move to emergency stations, new surprises occur. Troi has to make command decisions, Worf has to deliver a baby (Funny part!), and Picard has to take care of three children, which helps him with tolerance with children."
2,Didn't last,"Loved the design and how it worked while it lasted. It started freezing up about a year after we bought it and would not ring or keep time. It would work for about 20 minutes after we unpluged it and pluged it back in, but then it would freeze on a certain time and act like it was working when it was not."
4,The best alternative to going to Budapest!,"Let's face it....Hungarian isn't easy! We can't really relate it to other languages (unless you speak Finnish...yeah right!!) But if you are ready to learn, Assimil does a great job of unravelling this puzzle which is Hungarian. The tapes do an impeccable job of helping you grasp the phonetics and intonations (VERY important). The translations are done in correct english so you understand and many times as word for word translations as well so you develop a sense of word order (also VERY important). Every unclear detail is explained in notes at the bottom of the page so you're never lost. Grammar is introduced gradually so as to not overwhelm the student. Text is practical, realistic and USEFUL! Being objective, the lessons can be a bit much towards the middle. There's a lot to learn! English and Hungarian have almost NOTHING in common. You can't get around that! Take it slowly! It will come. it's the next best thing to having a private tutor!"
3,Good,This is a useful book lots of good tables etc. But you need a question book also like review questions for usmle step 3.
4,Crushes the other Review Books,"This book crushes the other review books. It also compliments them. This book is concise, thorough, and up to date. It was particularly helpful for the CCS section of the exam. It also has many convient tables, and a few photographs. Using this book along with Swanson's, and a CD-ROM with many multiple choice questions (MCQ) can almost guarantee a decent passing score."
3,Good in parts,This is a good book in terms of conciseness.At times you feel that it is too concise.The case scenarios are very practical and original.The information contained in this book is very less and this book is useful for those who are about to write the exam in 2 or 3 days.
1,dont buy from Amazon,"Tried to buy this book from Amazon. After nearly one month waiting, they said it would delayed another 2+ weeks. However they did offer me free 2 day shipping, trouble was I never knew when they would ship it?? Went to Wal-Mart.com (which I HATE Wal-Mart), was sent in one day, got the newest edition, received it good condition for same price. AMAZON.com SUCKS!!"
5,A must have bible for all bible students who want to study and share the word,"Great binding but a bit big. Large letters, clear easy to read and excellent referencing system. Still getting used to it though."
4,"Finally, a complete history","The thing that grabbed my attention about this book while in the store, and kept it through the last page, was the complete and unbiased view of the German people.Look through the books written on German history and you'd swear that they arrived from outer space around the year 1938, maybe 20 years earlier if you're lucky.The Germanic people occupied the largest area of land in Europe and yet prior to WWII, its as if they never existed. Germany still has a huge bias against it left over from WWII. A Mighty Fortress is a fair look at the history of the Germanic people and can really open people's eyes to their contributions to the world."
4,Nice hate but TIGHT!!,"I should have paid attention to the other reviews. I didn't, and I ordered a medium...it goes on my head, but it is TIGHT! I can count my pulse without touching a vein....hmm, 65 right now, not too bad.That said, its a nice hat, I like it...just do yourself a favor and order a size higher."
3,"Some good, some bad","I ordered 3 pairs. One gray, two black. The gray pair is great; soft, good proportions, fits well. The black pairs are comically large, thinner fabric, and not as soft. The black ones go way past my knees (I ordered large and I'm 6'4"" so past my knees is a long way). I'm returning the black pairs (1 star). I would order more gray ones (5 stars) if I knew I would get the ""good"" size instead of the ""comical"" size."
4,A too-small step forward,"Ever since I saw a performance of 1000 Airplanes on the Roof when I was in college, I have been a fan of Mr. Glass. When I first heard the Civil WaRS, I was absolutely floored. The first two tracks of this work seem much different (and much more mature) than his works to date. However, the self-indulgent Robert Wilson/Laurie Anderson narration on tracks three and four snapped me back to reality. Glass has grown but has not outgrown some of his worse avant garde modernist habits. Phil, the 80's are over! These ploys were interesting when they were fresh, but now they just are stale and annoying. If this work did not have the stream-of-consciousness narration, I would feel that Glass had finally managed to break through to a new level of excellence. If you are a fan of Glass who is not bothered by long passages of nonsensical glossolalia, you might like this CD. Otherwise, just buy it and play the absolutely phenomenal tracks 1 & 2 over and over again."
2,Just throw out your stuff and save your money,"Since I am a clutter-aholic, I have read oodles of organizing books and de-cluttering books and this one is the least inspired. He seems to be just filling space with each topic, rather than offering any new insights or ideas. For this particular topic, I recommend the Messie's Manual for a beginner and Julie Morgenstern's Organizing from the Inside Out for some practical tips. The best part about Clutter Control is a guide on page 137 giving suggestions of how long you should keep certain kinds of documents. I ripped out page 137 and threw the book away. The latest organizing book I've read is David Allen's Getting Things Done. It is awesome for paper clutter, one of my worst problems. I seem to be making progress!To be fair to Jeff Campbell, his book, Speed Cleaning is THE BEST on the subject of how to clean."
5,Great Book!,"This little handbook is definately something to put in the ""Keep"" pile. I was amazed at how many useful ideas, suggestions and tidbits this little volume held. Everything was practical and could be easily implemented.It's also very easy to read, unlike another organizing book I purchased at the same time."
4,Great,"After shopping around, this model has all the features I was looking for at the best price. It works perfect and we have had no problems at all. The only downside is that you have to take the entire unit out of the headreset harness in order to change the DVD, which, on longer trips lasting over one movie, it is time for a rest stop anyway when you have a couple of young ones.Overall, great value"
4,Had To Keep Reading!,"I found Anna Maxted's first book randomly in a used bookstore, loved it. Being Committed didn't fail either. I love the humor of Anna Maxted and the moral to her stories. Jack was an awesome character to me, you could always tell he cared. I was going on a cruise & forgot this book in the car and wanted to cry, that's how bad I wanted to read it. When I got home I dived into it and I couldn't put it down. I also loved her job as a P.I., who wouldn't want to do that? I would recommended any of Anna Maxted's book to everyone, you finish every book on a happy note, even if it's entire caios through out!"
5,Clean smelling,"I enjoy this fragrance, it's not too old lady smelling, not too young and sweet...it's just right for me. I especially like that you have to get pretty close to smell it. It's not one of those that knocks you down as you walk by."
5,"Battlefield survival, and how to prevail.","Gunny Poole puts iron on target again. The Tigers Way is an in depth examination of Asian/Oriental small unit tactics, and how the American Army needs to restructure its command and control systems, as well as soldier training. The book is highly detailed and sometimes makes for tedious readng, but is very thorough. The appendices even include some training drills to improve our troops' knowledge base. I highly recommed this to any serving member of the infantry, from PV1 to flag rank."
4,Think about it...,"In essence, this one of the series gives one pause to consider the plundering of ancient artifacts. Thank goodness, it's only fiction!"
5,Truth?,That Lindsey Williams is a minister and that he has little to gain from his story(some money some fame) and most importantly that he is acting on his belief demonstrated in the way he conducts his daily life lends even more credence to his story. We now hear Alaska is going to get a natural gas pipeline some 30 years later. For anyone searching for the truth and who is not so blind as to believe all the governmental authorities tell us this is a good place to start your own research.
2,Wouldn't suggest it,I've had problems with alarm stem. It's bascially impossible to 'activate' without pulling the entire thing out of the watch. It strips the treads out or they were stripped when I bought it. I don't have time to send back so I just don't use the alarm function. Downside of buying 'online.' I've also been getting an alergic reaction to the band - which I've never had from many other leather watch bands so I already have to replace it.
5,A literary gem,"This book changed my life and because of it Dinesen has become a major influence in my writing. She was an amazing woman living in an amazing time and she managed not only to capture her own voice in text, but also the voice of an entire generation. Her intelligence and strong yet frail personality is very subtle in her narration, but at the same time very apparent. I highly recomend this book not only for its literary merits but also for its beautiful setting, which was made more beautiful after benn filtered through Dinesen's eyes.If you would like to continue to read about Dinesen and her time period I would also reccomend:West With the Night (Beryl Markham) Out of Isak Dinesen in Africa EXCELLENT BOOK Straight on Till Morning (Mary S. Lovell)"
1,Embarrassed by mis-printing.,I bought this book for my son who had it on his wish list. Imagine my embarrassment when he discovered the book started on page 35 and then repeated from page 35. The replacement sent by Amazon had the same defect. Amazon better check their inventory on this book. And then send it back to the publisher.
2,Disappointed,"Very disappointing. His first two are essential to anyone interested in the markets. I read them over and over. This one had a few interviews that were almost unreadable. One guy buys stocks that hit new lows and then waits for them to come back. Anyone in trading knows that that is a tough game, let alone a ""traders"" edge? I'm surprised he was included in the book, even with his track record. I know there are plenty of better traders out there that I would rather read about. Why was David Shaw included? He was afraid to even confirm what markets he traded, no insight in that interview. Useless. Schwager is an excellent author, who in my humble oponion, rushed this book out to meet the demand for stock market books recently."
1,marketing tool for the market wizard fund,"I have to say that this is indeed the worst of the Market Wizard books. I got the feeling that it was written as a marketing tool for Mr. Schwaeger's Market Wizard Fund of funds.One interview that I found particularly annoying was Stephen Lescarbeau, who only agreed to the interview because of Gil Blake's interview in MW II. Unlike Mr. Blake, he revealed nothing about his methodology, only the inspiration for it. Further, I see from Mr. Lescarbeau's review of the book, he was surprised by the information divulged by the other wizards. He should have done likewise or not have been included in the book."
4,Learning is fun,Interesting book that is helping me to understand the stock market and how and why it works the way it does. Well written.
4,Market Wizards Replay,"A reasonable book, but more or less the same as Market Wizards, or the New Market Wizards.Not much new content / experience after reading the first two books on the topic, but still a few new faces & new stories.Reading two of the three titles is quite enough to get the gist on how to invest, but Schwager still rulez!"
2,Not L'Engle's best,"Muddled, predictable, and far too black-and-white. The evil characters are completely evil; you lose all sympathy for Adam as he continues to be confused about which characters to trust and obey. The Young Unicorns is a much tighter, more compelling thriller and much more interesting in its exploration of good and evil. Please read The Young Unicorns for L'Engle at her best."
4,Excellent Book!!!,"I am not the intended audience, never the less I found this book full of interesting information. This book will also be of value to flight simmers and airline passengers who want to know more details about flying. The book is easy to follow and full of good illustrations which complements the text.Highly recommended!"
3,HALF HEARTED,"I must admit that when I first come across this book on Amazon.com I really wanted to buy it. I felt though after I read it, it left me a little ""flat"" I think that one should read Morrel's other books "" Brotherhood of The Rose"" and ""Fraternity of The Stone"" before tackling this one. However, I will give David another chance with ""Brotherhood of The Rose"" before I make an accurate judgement on his style.By all means - read this book. Just read the other two in the series first to fully enjoy it."
2,Not my kind of novel,"This book is nothing special. Imagine George R.R. Martin's a song of ice and fire but make it boring and hard to follow with a really so so narrative and no emotion-you'd get this book.This is basically just like the normal Middle Ages, but with monsters and other creatures that are never explained. Take normal human conflicts, throw in some obscure stuff, and viola-here is the Kings Dragon, a boring and extremely typical fantasy book. I can't say I'd recommend it just because there's nothing really good about it (although, there's nothing bad either) and nothing grabbed my attention in any way. I won't continue on with the series and I'm not interested in this author anymore. Maybe this book is more for people who like intrigue fantasy or more normal fantasy books, stuff with nothing really fantastic in it, but this just wasn't my kind of book."
3,Simple but works,"I have an Pioneer AVIC-D1 Navigation System, and this adapter works with it but it's functions are very simple. Like it won't show the complete name of the song, and to find something you can only go up or down. But I don't mind, I use my playlists on my ipod"
1,Daring? How about don't you dare buy this book!,"Note: If I could give this 0 stars, I wouldI picked up this book on the strength of the high recommendations listed here - I guess I should have looked at the fact that there were only (5) reviews. This book was trite, un-even, and just plain ridiculous. It started out with a decent enough premise but did nothing to really build the relationship between the hero and heroine.Maggie came off as a young, naive, totally unrealistic, ""I'm trying to be cute & pert"" but, I'm not. It's almost as if the character ""Ally McBeal"" were thrust into a book. The plot veered off in directions that didn't get tied up and the Hero, Connor, seemed to be spouting lines because that's what he was supposed to say rather than what he felt.Also, there wasn't too much of anything that was daring in this book. Just Ugghhh! I feel sad that I dared to buy this. Just run the other way - get something by Gaelen Foley (The Duke) or Lisa Kleypas (Dreaming of You) instead"
3,review of tempted,It was an interesting movie but not the one I thought I was getting. I thought I was getting the movie Tempted that was made by Lifetime Movie Network which I would still like to buy but I don't think that it is available for purchase.
1,Could be much better.,"Needs to be much more nuts and boltsy, and less soft survey like. As an example, doesn't even define what makes a bank regulatable as a bank -- one of the most basic issues in banking law."
2,College Material,"I started trying to read French, Cajun, Creole, Houma for research to write articles for my website. www.gettingtochoose.com is a website to read about Louisiana and it's culture, plus just stories in general about our family. I have picked the book up several times and I find it's for a very seasoned reader. Well educated reader to be more precise, of course I didn't know at the time when I ordered this book that it was copyrighted by Louisiana State University Press in Baton Rouge, La. It's not that the book doesn't have information that I wanted it's just hard to comprehend and a dictionary is needed most of the time."
3,Not what I expected,"This was an interesting collection of essays by writers about writing. However, I was expecting a collection of short stories, so if you are looking for mysteries, don't purchase this book. If you are interested in the authors' motivations, it is a nice read."
1,"WANTED A CD, NOT TAPE",Utterly disappointed. Ordered a CD and received a damned audio TAPE. MAD AS HELL ..!!
5,Stranger Safety -DVD,ALL PARENTS SHOULD GET THIS FOR THEIR CHILDREN-It teaches their children about strangers and why they need to protect themselves. A+++ My Children LOVE watching it! EVERY CHILD SAFE IS WELL WORTH IT! Thank you!
5,Great!,"This DVD provides so much information about staying safe. My son learned a lot by watching it and it's opened up discussions we might not otherwise have had. I really liked how the program classified people, especially the kinda knows, making children aware that even though they think know people, they really don't. I also liked how they visually described personal space by drawing a circle around a child and their ""safe"" personal space on a playground."
4,Exactly what I ordered,Thanks for the informative video that will help my children stay safe.The product was received shortly after I ordered it on Amazon. Good deal for the content contained in the Stranger Safety video.
5,Great Safety Primer for Kids,"I bought this DVD for my five year old daughter. I am very impressed that the makers were able to convey so much about safety in an honest forum without making it seem scary. The information is clear and practical examples are given. Real life situations are enacted which made it much easier for my daughter to understand how she could use the lessons taught. The DVD is presented in a fun, entertaining way without ever talking down to the viewer. My daughter has enjoyed watching it several times and feels very good about knowing how to keep herself safe. I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone looking to educate their child about everyday safety."
1,Orthodox need not apply,"This collection purports to be a scholarly study of the moral teaching of His Holiness Pope John Paul II. But all the authors dissent from the teaching of the Church on morals. The result is a trashing of the Pope's teaching: not very fair, not very convincing, not very noble. Give me Humanae Vitae any day."
5,When Godly People Do Ungodly Things,"Beth Moore is down where the people are. She's speaks where we can hear. I especially appreciate When Godly People Do Ungodly Things. As I read this book it was timely for my life. It supported a learning experience I had gone through earlier in my life. Seduction is hard to recognize and we are told repeatedly not to let anyone do that to us, but it happens. This book helps one know what to do to get free. I highly recommend this book especially in this day and time."
5,A Glimpse of The People Behind An Old Familiar Story From The Bible,"I very much enjoyed this novel. Sometimes I just scan past parts of the Bible because I can't relate to them as people. I don't know what their lives even might have been like. Although we don't really know all the facts, it helps to put flesh on the stories, to remind us that they really were people, with hopes and fears and dreams."
5,Cute and Cool,"First of all i want to say that this was a great book. The Tennis fans will espesially like it. I don't usually read that kind of stories, but I took this one randomly and was amazad how sweet and kind of naive it was. I liked Tay and Asher very much. I recomend this book to all of you with romantic hearts. Ms. Roberts, You've done a great job through the years! Keep it up!"
1,Barbarian Invasion game,"This order was received 2 days later than the date on the emails that I received pertaining to delivery date. The game was in French not English and when I attempted to return it, I was informed the date for doing so had passed."
5,Philosophical Essential,"Toril Moi's ""What is a Woman? And Other Essays"" is essential reading for further development of a feminist consciousness, compelling and clearly delivered. Complex feminist theory is presented in logical, comprehensible full detail; the philosophical esoterica of feminist thought is coupled with its practical relevance. A definitive thinker at her very best."
3,A little on the shallow side,"This is - as far as I can tell - the first book to ever really talk about fitness as applied to motor racing. Other books have tackled the mental aspects, and there's more books on driving technique than the world really needs, but the subject of physical training for motorsport is not covered much at all.So I was very disappointed to find that this book was much more shallow than I had anticipated. It's more about general guidelines and rough ideas than about the specifics of developing a training regimen for a driver.Given that the author seems to have had access to a number of notable drivers, this is a seriously lost opportunity. What does David Colthard or Colin McRae's weekly workout schedule look like? I don't know, because the book doesn't answer that question.If the author (or someone in a similar position) is reading - give us the information required to set up a training programme for a top-level driver. More detail!"
1,This is a book that is dangerous and kills trusting readers,"This book is dangerous and should be avoided or read with great caution. First, the Bible says it should not be added to, or mixed with odd explanations, as the author consistently does. Unknowingly, trusting readers rely on the teachings contained here and are severely hurt physically and emotionally. I found it constantly contradicted the Bible. Abiding by its claims and teachings almost caused a death in my family and in did cause deaths in families of my friends who also relied on what the book says. The author was later found to be involved in drugs and gave away her own son after several divorces, I learned after further research. A book about this book entitled The Religion That Kills better explains the danger of this book."
4,good item-MISIDENTIFIED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Susan Hill is a good writer. Unfortunately, Amazon is incompetent at identifying books by language of publication. This clearly reads ""Spanish"" and all of the editions for sale are also clearly in English. This needs to be remedied, as it is the most serious failing of what otherwise is a good system."
4,Excellent Bridge Builder!!!,"This and the ""Mountain of Silence"" are excellent introductory books into the spirituality of the Eastern Church. I am a little disappointed by his belief that eastern spirituality is radically different than western forms of spirituality. Although I agree that in Catholiscism there is often too great an emphasis on legalism and organization, I think we need to give the many western saints and spiritual, monastic teachers more credit. Furthormore, I was slighly dissapointed by the somewhat relativistic sounding ending.This is however one of the best books to give to a liberal, anti-organized religion person. It could help open their eyes. That is indeed the audience more books about Christianity should be directed if the faithful want to bring people back into the church!!"
3,Preaching to the choir,"Markides enjoys a reputation as an authority on Eastern Orthodoxy, and especially the mystical aspects thereof. This is the first book by him I've read. I enjoyed his portrayal of his Orthodox mentor, a man of some weight in Greek Orthodoxy. That said, I found Markides' grasp of Greek and of some aspects of Orthodox theology a bit weak. He states his own strong beliefs well and certainly communicates his respect for his mentor, but the book is not really about desert monasticism as much as it is about the views of one (rather remarkable) Orthodox monk and priest. If this whole subject area interests you, as it does me, then by all means read this book, but read lots of others too!"
5,Very Reliable,I received a used book in top-notch condition. I fully recommend purchasing the book from this company.
5,good old fashioned rock italian style,this is a creative albumn from the boys of litfiba. it's solid guitar riffs and fun lyrics makes it a 5 star listener. i recommend this for anyone interested in italian rock and roll.
1,WHAT A STUPID VAMPIRE MOVIE!!!!!!!,If you can stay away from this movie it was stupid it had no story and i thought that the other two Dracula movies were way better then this one!!!!!! LIKE I SAID BEFORE STAY AWAY FROM THIS STUPID MOVIE IT'S NOT WORTH RENTING OR BUYING!!!!!
3,Why?,"I really am leery of sequels, and this is the third installment of the dracula 2000 series. First of all, Dracula (Rutger Hauer) wasn't all that strong a character and it doens't really explain why they have changed his face for the third time. The one performance that I thought I liked was Scott Jason Lee and the ending. Don't expect alot from this, its only entertainment..But, if you are anything like me, I have the three installments....Still like the first the best...and again with the ending, will there be a forth?"
5,TR'ES BIEN,Indochine is full of strength beauty ; it is a revolutionary masterpiece in french movies . The leading actress Catherine Deneuve is so perfect ; she is as beautiful as ever. Indochine is one of the best movies in 90` .
4,Best foreign film I've seen so far.,The setting is wonderful...I just thought everything came together perfectly.
2,Do better research next time,"Well written and engaging most of the time. I, however, was distracted because of the many errors. At one point, if one had gone south as the direction to a location indicated, the person would have ended up in the Atlantic Ocean. When writing ""historical fiction"" that is of a current situation it is important to get the facts straight and often these were not. I was living in Liberia when much of this story occurred and know some could not have been true. Since most of the Liberia story was in the last twenty years readers may feel they understand, but just because it is published does not mean it is true. Actually, when I completed reading the book, and I read it all to see what truth I could find, I dumped it in a garbage can. What a waste of good talent - misleading people about events in a country they may never see! Reader beware."
1,Another poor title from 989,"Here we have yet another in a long line of half-hearted attempts by 989 studios. Sony just cannot make good sports games, as we have seen in pretty much every version of X-games, Faceoff, MLB, and NBA. It's obvious they take all, and by 'all' I mean ALL, their ideas from EA Sports, leaving the originality and innovation up to someone else, as usual. Stick with the original and best hockey available, EA Sports NHL 2001. Heck, NHL '94 on my Genesis is more fun than this."
2,Not up to the standards of other baby signs DVDs,"My son loved the My Baby Can Talk sign language DVDs and he loves Baby Einstein, so I thought this would be perfect for him. I was so, so wrong. The DVD is not done in a manner that promotes learning. The words are combined too much, instead of focusing on one word at a time. I would not bother with this DVD if you really want your baby to learn sign language. We love baby sign and can highly recommend the My Baby Can Talk series instead of this DVD."
4,Beautifully made,"I like this one, epecially for the hearing impared. My baby can hear but loves to see the signs with thier hands I really like it."
2,Disappointing,I bought this for my 2yr old who has a speech delay. There were only 20 signs and more than a few were common signs that we already knew. My son does like watching it but as far as learning new signs it was a bust.
5,Baby Einstein,"I can communicate with my 15 month old and actually understand her now. No more guessing, this video works. I just love it!!! I recommend it to anyone who has a toddler, it's amazing how quick our children can learn."
1,Terrible - 1 Star too many,"Yet another ""horror"" flick which doesn't do anything to build any level of suspense or tension. Every move made is one expected. Every little ""boo, here I am"" is yet another ""ooo, ahh, didn't see that coming"" moment. A part of my life I would gladly like to have back to invest into something else. What is worse, I can't believe that Luke Wilson or Kate Beckinsale would associate themselves with this below B flick. Not to say that they are outstanding, yet I would have expected something more."
4,Great creepy fun!,"Thos one took me by surprise. I was expecting your standard currently-trendy capture/torture film, but this was so much better. The villians are truly creepy, thes sets perfect 60's Psycho kitsch, and the perfomances are fine. Actually, we were often on the edge of our seats with this one. A good creepy ride!"
3,An average thriller/slasher...,"...although I would not really consider it a slasher as it lacks the gore and body count of such. The story: a couple make a detour while on a trip, their car breaks down, end up in some old Motel, then end up fighting for their lives. Not a horrible movie, however, as I said before, a very very low body count, and not enough suspense or action to fill in the gaps. As far as the HD presentation, I was disappointed, I've seen better HD transfers, this one is not one of them (maybe it is because most of the movie takes place in the dark). I have not seen the DVD version, but this did not look that much different from a standard DVD. Worth as a rental, and a rental only."
2,"NOTHING NEW IN THIS SHORT, BUT ENTERTAINING TIME WASTER!","This movie doesn't waste much time ""getting to it"". Clocking in at less than 1 hour and 20 minutes(not counting the long credits in the beginning and the end)once this film gets going it does not let up. Although very tense, it's riddled with clichÃ©s and you know how it's going to end, but it's short and enjoyable on a juvenile level. Check it out on cable. I rate it 2 1/2 stars."
4,Quite thrilling and entertaining,I am not a big fan of horror movies in that they are good to watch once and usually I don't really take anything away from them. Vacancy is not necessarily a horror movie but has that same feel to it. There is not a lot of weird or gross blood scenes to it but does bring an element of suspense and thrill that horror movies have. Reminded me somewhat of 'Disturbia' in the way it plays out not that it is a copy of that film. If you enjoy suspenseful thrillers than give it a watch and you should enjoy it.Peter J. Miller
4,Not the best....but I think MIGHTY Underated,"I've heard people complain that this movie was the worst thing they'd ever seen, and that it was boring, and that it was stupid. But I gave the movie a shot and you know what? I really enjoyed it.True, there are some weak points in the movie, but that had to do with the script thankfully and not the acting. Beckinsale, Wilson, and Whaley played three very believable characters. This wasn't a stupid slasher about revenger or some myastical force, this was something that was and felt very real, a quality lacking from many movies today. I only gave it four stars, because the ending could have been done a little better.If you want to see a snuff film, (Ahem Saw ahem) then no this may seem boring to you. But if you're like me, and you're like a good suspense thriller, this movie was for the most part, very well done."
5,The Promised Land,"I bought ""The Promised Land"" because some my ancestors came from Poland and Russia and settled in chelsea Ma at around the same time. Antin's description and stories of life in Polotzk makes it easy for me to imagine what it might have been like for my family as well. Her description of a new life in America is very much like stories I have heard from my great uncles who settled in Boston and Chelsea. Her characters are three dimensional and I like her descriptive style."
4,Have to have patience,"This is a great deal, but you need to know that these are probably seconds and that is why the price is so low. Some of the pieces had scratches or dings in the finish. However with Amazon's return policy I was able to order a few sets, pull the good pieces out and exchange out the bad ones. After a couple times of doing this I was able to get a great set for 16 people and way cheaper than what I would have gotten it for at Macy's. I think it took 6 sets to get 4 perfect sets. Also if you are not that picky, the marks are mainly very minor. Amazon covered the cost of shipping because the product was defective.This set has a nice solid feeling and looks very tasteful. I am very satisfied with this purchase. Like I said, it just took a little patience to get the quality I expect from this manufacturer."
1,You can skip this one,"I looked forward to watching this dvd. However, it is a bit boring, even for political junkies. It was one of the first political documentaries, and so has real historical value. However, it could have used a modern commentator to put everything into context. The film relies too heavily on long scenes focussing on the candidates maybe saying something, maybe not, and what they do say is not always worth the time."
2,it's no LOS OLVIDADOS,"Predictable revenge story about a heavily tattooed south american gang member, south american gang violence, and bringing such violence to the united states, with a lot of it on board a EMPEROR OF THE NORTH 1970s movie train.You really have to be the most bleeding heart to find anything uplifting in all this boredom, with a cliched love story thrown in; even the violence and brief nudity is average.In spanish---but made by gringos.If you like quentin tarintino junk, you might like this violent junk, though."
4,A Love Story,"I was interested in purchasing this movie due to the fact that I had seen previews at a theater and it looked quite captivating. When it was released in video, I tried renting it for 2 months and it was never available so I just assumed that it was a popular movie. I decided to purchase it and the movie was different than what I had expected. It was a love story but moreso it had a twist that was quite a realistic plot about gang life of the MS-13 El Salvadoran gang and the gang culture and about what happens when you try to leave the gang. It also depicts the illegal immigrant way of life and the dangers encompassing their escape to the U.S. The story ending was very sad, almost depressing, but it leaves the viewer with the hope and anticipating that the young lady will be able to start a new life of freedom and opportunity."
4,The movie that reveals its inner self,"In the far future apes have taken over the world and mankind is made up of two groups... speechless primitives and subterranean mutants. Once again, it isn't necessary to really be into sci-fi to enjoy this movie. Lots of fun as well as some preachiness."
4,Very Deadly,"Beneath the planet of the apes is a good movie. Last time,Talyor and Nova where off to find a place to live and Dr.Cornelius and Zira were arrested. Now a friend of Talyor,Brent has crashed on the planet. Brent meets Nova and the two of them have to find Talyor."
3,"A bit of a let down, but it still has Heston","Most sequels aren't as good as the original and this movie proves the point. The plot has potential but loses it about a 1/3 of the way through the movie. James Franciscus is a pseudo-Heston who, although he resembles him facially, lacks Chuck's larger physical stature and command presence. Unfortunately, we only see a bit of Heston, but he takes care of business at the end; which proves the point that if you want something done, you must do it yourself. Heston annhilates the apes at the end, proving his superiority. One other point of interest is the superb job of re-creating a New York subway tunnel buried beneath the desert which serves as the mutants's domain."
3,Interesting for the time period.,"The most annoying part was that the movie streaming kept on being interrupted. Nonetheless the kids still wanted to continue watching - so must the movie is still interesting, even to younger generation"
2,Labor Pains Is Pretty Painful To Watch,"Labor Pains while not a completely horrible movie, is pretty hard to watch. This movie does not have a good script and the acting certainly didn't add anything. There is very little character development, most of the characters never move beyond one dimensional, ... and completely unbelievable people. The acting in this movie is some of the worse I have ever seen, even the more famous actors like Mary Tyler Moore completely over act. This movie is supposed to be a romantic comedy, but I never laughed once. I wouldn't rent this movie, but if it is on TV and you are bored I would give it a try."
4,Instrument tuner for a cello,This tuner came highly recommended by my daughter's orchestra teacher. Not all tuners work well with a cello. This has been excellent and easy to use.
2,"Durable, but dim.","I bought these because of my past experience with them. Many years ago I used this brand and style when I lived and worked in a remote part of the world. I remember them as being sturdy and durable with a bright light. The two new ones I bought don't feel as sturdy or durable (they feel more brittle), but they are much better than most anything else you can buy except for the Maglite brand. However, the light given off by the bulb is dim. So much so I originally thought it was due to the new batteries I put in. I put in another set of brand new Duracell batteries, but the result was the same.If I could I would give these 2.5 stars. That many because of the durability and that few because of the dimness of the bulb. Someday I'll get around to buying some new bulbs and that may help.Tom"
3,Non-Conductive Flashlight,"Ordered this for work. When I received it, the on/off switch was flimsy. If the light was on, by just touching the switch a little it would go off. If the light was off, by just touching the switch a little the light would come on. This caused problems as I use this at work and store it in my tot bag. A few times I found the light on when I opened my bag. So, I tired to return the light to Amazon. They told me to keep it. So, I threw it away. It was fairly new two (2) weeks old. But I couldn't take it apart to repair the switch so it was useless. A friend at work has one and his works perfectly so I'm sure I just got a bad unit. For the price you can't go wrong but it has to work properly or it's nothing but weight to carry in your bag."
1,riipoff,"i recently purchased this product and was very disappointed.the light comes on for like a nano second then goes out and gets very hot to touch.will not buy again,and will also tell friends not to."
4,Flashlight,It lights up. That in itself makes it a good flashlight. When it is dark and you turn it on you can see. This is an amazing invention.
1,Avoid this flashlight (Amazon),Purchased one which turned out to be defective. Cap for battery compartment would not screw back on -- the threads would not align.Ordered a replacement unit. Same problem. Save yourself the headache and look elsewhere.
3,For the busy student,"Although Pappas' book on the Republic is well written and fairly detailed, I feel that it adds little to the two standard texts: Julia Annas' and Nicholas White's. In fact Pappas admits in his introduction that he has drawn a lot from these. Pappas' study can be a good choice for the student in a rush, but it is not the best for an in-depth study of the text."
3,Losing plot,"Characters are described in a lot of detail but half of the read delves into boring details of each character which does not contribute to the general plot of the book. So many pages are wasted which could have been better spent focusing on true fantasy. Who cares about Elaynes moodswings during her pregnancy, the whole relationship thing between Mat and Tuon...how much can be written about the traveling shown and how each day goes by...man, what happened to real fantasy/fiction?Half of the book is focussed on random daily events that seems totally senseless and devoid of any reason or meaning."
1,Stay Away,"You should stay away from this whole series. Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time moves at a glacial pace. He has far too many characters. He's turned his main hero, Rand, into such a wimp I'm rooting for the Dark Forces. It takes Jordan multiple books to wrap up scenerios that should take a few chapters. I'm sorry to hear he is ill, but he will die before he can come close to finishing this series. If you want to read an exciting series that actually accomplishes something within each book I would recommend George R.R. Martin's a Game of Thrones."
1,Still not recieved,Can't really give a review of the book. Its been over a month and it still hasn't arrived. But I am in Afghanistan so its probably stuck in customs some where
1,Hasn't Jordan put this series to bed yet?,I refuse to buy another book in this series (as of two books ago) until Jordan finishes it. Until then I am reading George R.R. Martin who does seem to be able to move his books along.
4,Come on - This is so much better...,"Come on - This is so much better...than Books 8-10. Like most readers, I was disappointed to say the least with those volumes, and was howling mad when I heard about the prequels...but in KoD, the plots all move forward, and quite deftly. You can already see how this is going to turn out, and that is what I am looking forward to after more than a decade reading Jordan. The man is immensely talented, and, though he got lost in the last couple of books, this one re-establishes him as the leader in the epic fantasy genre...All authors who attempt an arching story line over 10000 pages (roughly) are bound to get sidetracked, but the charm that was present in the first books of the series has returned, and we are now only 2 books away from finishing this."
2,Will this never end,"Having stuck it out through all 11 books and the sequel, I am astounded that such a brilliant plot line could be turned into such a boring set of books. You have to conscientiously make the effort to drag on a story as slowly as this one has gone. On the rare occasions that the author gets around to advancing the plot, the books are interesting but unfortunately this doesn't occur very often. These 11 books could have been condensed into 2 or 3 fast paced, attention getter novels. I only actually read one of these books, the rest were listened to on audio during gym workouts and long drives. I learned they are a great sleeping pill substitute. If a 12th book is indeed printed, I will read it but I will have no thoughts of being saddened that the story is over."
2,Why 4 or 5 stars?,"People say stuff finally happens and gives it 4 or 5 stars on that basis, why? Ok, a few things happen but they are completely out of proportion to the time spent building them up and the resolutions are something I would expect a 10 year old to come up with. No offense to all the 10 year olds who think Jordans writing is juvenile.This book gets two stars for finally resolving stuff, even though it is done in a unbelievable and unintelligent manner. I am starting to believe that someone else wrote books 1-4 for Jordan, because no one could go from writing well-written(but highly derivative) books, to the dreck in the past few installments. Either that or Jordan has suffered from brain damage."
1,I hate Robert Jordan's books!,"Robert Jordan owes every person who has ever read a page of his books a personal apology. I have yet to receive mine.This book is only fit for wiping one's posterior (though I would personally recommend Charmin - it's more interesting to read).As you know George R.R. Martin's Feast of Crows comes out in November. Run, don't walk, to buy it.Also:""As our history doth not, like a newspaper, give great characters to people who never were heard of before, nor will ever be heard of again, the reader may hence conclude that this excellent woman will hereafter appear to be of some importance in our history.""TOM JONES, Henry Fielding. Take a lesson Mr. Jordan."
1,Good Lord what's with all the spanking???,"OK, like many others here, I'm disappointed (but he got my $20 anyway...). Simply stating that its not as bad as the last book isn't praise. I think this series actually died a few books past, but for some reason I had to continue to read. This one was the nail in the coffin though. Too many minor characters taking the main stage, too many plotlines that I really dont care about.And what's up with all the spankings!? I mean honestly, enough already.Jordan said in an interview there will be one more book in this series and then its done. I've decided after this many books NOT to buy that one because I really didnt enjoy this one, and I really cant see how he's going to neatly tie everything up in one novel (unless its about 5000 pages long).I still think Jordan is a great writer, I just think he let himself go with this series and wrote himself into too many corners to get out of successfully."
3,"Good read, serires back on track with this book","While Knife of Dreams was not the best book of the series, it certainly took a step in the right direction and was MUCH better than the previous installment, Crossroads of Twilight. I felt like the pace was much faster, the story had the benefit of better editing, and a few of the smaller story lines where brought to conclusion. The main stories moved along, and the characters are one step closer to the final battle.As with the last few books, there are a couple of stories that tend to get too much attention and over the top with details."
4,Moves the story on well.,"Robert Jordan's latest work was a satisfying read. Towards the end of the book I kept hoping that suddenly another chapter would materialize to allow the saga to continue. Alas, we will all have to wait until the next book of adventure arrives.No spoilers: The book ties up a number of issues from preceding novels and interjects some interesting twists that leave the reader wanting more. I'm not jaded from this series. It is a pleasure to read about a world being fleshed out carefully with each new chapter rather than simply having a hurried ending trying to messily tie up all the details.Bravo!"
4,"Finally, improvement.","I have been reading this series from when the first book came out. I even went back and bought the first book in hard-back (very hard to find at the time). The last few books have been a chore to read, although I felt that the last book (Crossroads of Twilight) wasn't that bad, probably a 3 star. The writing and storyline of Knife of Dreams recall the first 5 or so books of the series. Not as good, but close. I am just hoping that book 12 (the last?) won't be 2 years in the making. I just realized that this series has stretched over 15 years, with The Eye of the World published in November of 1990. 15 years!"
1,Class Action Lawsuit,"A book series is a contract between the Author, the Publisher, and the reader. The Wheel of Time violated every contractual obligation implied by continually attempting to have us readers buy books without end. This series should be completed, and the final book should be offered FREE of CHARGE to all owners of the first 4 books.If this does not happen, I propose a Class Action Lawsuit against the Publisher and Robert Jordan's estate.May Robert Jordan rest in peace.P.S. I wish I could rate this series a 0, for all of the disappointment it has caused to most of its readers!"
3,Disapointing,"I was very excited when I was finally able to buy this book; I have been looking forward to it ever since I found out the date it was going to be released. However, after reading Knife of Dreams I was very disapointed in the book. I don't feel like it was as good as many of Robert Jordan's books. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed it, but it seemed like not much happened. There were a few key events, and a few of my suspicians were confirmed. But everything that happened seemed like it was rushed through, I think half the information that was revealed could have easily been added to the next book rather than have a 760 pg. book of pretty much just fluff. This book is vital to the series...but if you have to don't buy it borrow the book. Overall well-written, but it seemed like a waste of my time. Very disapointing!"
3,Knife of Dreams(or how do we pronounce their names),"The book started off fairly good and then it swap back and forth between charactors who I could not remember from the previous book, much less pronounce their names,and also I get tired of who has what on, lets get back to the to the story line and plot, move faster on the action, and for pete sake, have them quit keeping secrets and open up with a little trust in the charactors."
2,There may be hope yet,There may be hope yet. I have been frustrated at these last couple books. They are full of things that I do not care about. Characters descriptions of things that do not matter. The only reason I will read this last book is because it is being written by Brandon Sanderson. He is one of the best authors I have ever read. If anyone can bring life back into this series it would be him.
1,Where did I see that before?,"There is so little originality in RJ's books. Now that Martin's Jaime has lost a hand and become an interesting character, Jordan does the same to a lifeless character here. Except that there will be no point to X losing their hand in RJ's world, and he can't hope to touch Martin's characterization, despite this desperate attempt. This Wheel is Dead. Don't bother to read this junk."
1,Getting Ridiculous,"I've read the other comments posted on this book. Congratulations to all of you. You actually made it past the 1st chapter. I myself began to read this and quickly got lost in all the excruciating detail that Robert Jordan has come to be famous for. He could have finished the series a long time ago if he would have chose to not go into so much detail, and actually leave something to the readers imagination.As this book stands, he leaves once again very very little to the reader's imagination, forcing the reader to try and keep up with exactly how Robert Jordan wants his world imagined.I myself have given up on the series. For those of you who have just read Eye of the World for the first time, I recommend abandoning the series before you waste your time."
1,Yet Another Failure,"IT is clear that RJ has hired someone to write positive reviews for this book. Many were posted here before the book went on sale, which shows that TOR and AMAZON know that they'll never sell this junk without cheating. I've read this book. It stinks. Here's why:Once AGAIN RJ delivers junk. Rand is AGAIN MIA for most of this book. When he appears, it's only to be whiny and annoying for a short time. There's more on Mat here--which is NOT a good thing. Once AGAIN the Aes Sedai are skirt-smoothing, icy-staring, sniffing, scowling, tea-drinking bosomy witches. Once AGAIN RJ's chapters meander into the realm of FILLER and once AGAIN the ending is a quick burst of unbelievable garbage that makes little to no sense."
1,There seem to be 350 unneeded pages (again),"Look, RJ must have been spending time reading Harry Potter, and at the same time trying to write the end to these useless WoT books. I can picture him reading Potter, and falling asleep with a WoT blank page in front of him; and picture him waking up the next day with 50 or so useless pages that were mysteriously written while he was asleep the night before. Dont waste your time. Semirhage kills people, Rand loses a hand (and isnt mentioned til like page 353 or something), Perrin ""rescues"" Faile, Mat and Tuon sort of get married, Elayne gets her required backers (and becomes Queen), Egwene gets spanked (unfortunately RJ didnt add pictures of this - that would have bumped my star rating up at least 2 stars), and Oh yeah - Moraine is still alive - Mat is supposed to ""rescue"" her. Dont bother, this is the worst WoT book yet. The next one could never be this bad, so we at least have something to look forward to."
1,Meth is GOOD!,"Hey all of you gloomy RJ fans, if you liked this series, I have an idea about something else you might like. That's right...METH! You get hooked on it and are always looking for the next high never quite being able to attain that first euphoric experience so you keep coming back for more while the product delivers less. It will waste your time and take you nowhere and in the end someone is likely to die! Sound familiar? Yippee! Meth!I'm sure glad he took the time to write that prequel."
3,Better than the last book... but still some slow bits!,"I am still reading this book (aprox half way though), and agree with a lot of the other reviews I have read.It is definitely better than the previous few books, but that isn't a huge achievement. Also, there is too much written about minor characters. Can't RJ just kill a few off to keep the book focused on the main ones???My main gripe is the speed of the book. The Perrin and Mat sections have been good thus far, but the prologue (85 pages!!!) is far too slow, and when it took Elayne some 30 pages just to walk from the outside of the castle to her room and get changed, it was too much!!! Supposedly this has had a full editorial review. Bah! Get new editors and speed this thing up a bit! Sheesh, we all know that WoT books can be good, have been good, and hopefully will be good again before the end.Still, I will finish the book, as it is mostly good, but mostly because I have been reading WoT for too long to stop now..."
1,Couldn't make it past the first sentence,"I picked this up at my local Wal-Mart, and read the first sentence, and nearly passed out from boredom. Really, first lines should be a hook, and this was not."
3,The worst fear of any WOT fan - Health Problems,"After reading and re-reading thousands of pages from the WOT series one of the largest fears in my life would be that Robert Jordan would die before the end of this series.I was on the TOR web site where Mr. Jordan has stated that he has come down with some disease. I cannot understate how much I wish him well, but PLEASE finish the series."
3,so far so good,"An easy read. Have read every book in the series thus far and this is among the best. One is caught up in anticipation that something's going to happen - right around the corner versus a few of the books, of late, in the series, that seemed only to be placeholders. I was reluctant to purchase this, at first, for fear it would be another one of them but it's not and I'm happy that I did."
4,"Still not like the first ones, but much better.","Although Knife of Dreams doesn't have the same break-neck pace as the first few books of this series, it definitely moves faster than the last few. I was very glad to see some of the plotlines that have been going on for the last three books come to an end. I also have to say that the stuff about the Aelfinn and Eelfinn intrigued me and seems like it's going to make the next book very interesting. I'm really looking forward to that next (and maybe final) one."
5,Good read,"The book was very informative though appeared padded by newspaper accounts of terrorist activities which made the book longer than it really needed to be. Excellent historical background which linked the past with the present, providing a how and why of our present circumstances."
3,Won't Work,"I'm returning this ladder, because my wall thickness at the window sill is slightly more than 13"" -- and the ladder support brackets are slightly too small to fit over the window ledge. The specs say 6""-13"", and I assumed it would work, since my wall thickness is around 12""; but there is one course of brick under each window that sticks out a little. So, be sure to measure your window sill before ordering.Looks like a well made ladder -- too bad the brackets won't stretch open a little further."
5,Great Product- Reusable,"This is a great product. It is built well and it necessary for any 2nd floor. I took it out of the box when it arrived, opened the ladder up, made sure it works, wrapped it back up and it fit back into the box easily. It is now under my bed. Definately recommend."
4,Fire escape ladders,"After seeing the movie ""Fireproof"" we decided it was time to protect our family. We searched for a good price and a company with a good reputation. The ladders came quickly and we checked them thoroughly. After a practice we have put them in place and are hoping to never have to use them!"
4,Very important to have!,An escape ladder is very important to have in rooms that are 2nd story or higher. This ladder is very affordable and sufficient to allow the access needed to escape through a window to avoid being burned or having to jump. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007OAPT0/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
3,2 story ladder will not work with wall thicker than 10 inches (at widest point),"The description on the Amazon website says it will fit walls 6 inches to 13 inches thick. This is not true for the 2-story ladder. The widest the ladder can open is 10 inches, as correctly reported in one of the prior reviews. The instructions included with the ladder also say the maximum thickness is 10 inches. If the wall is 10 inches thick, the ladder will likely not work, either, since it probably won't hang right. In order to hang as shown in the picture, the wall can only be 9 inches thick. Measure the thickest part of your wall including interior and exterior sills. If you have a brick house, the ladder likely will not work. My wall was 12 inches, and the ladder cannot reach around it. Otherwise, it looked well-made."
3,Excellent Product.,Excellent Product. Manufacturers should stay away from using nylon though as nylon melts if close to fire. I think anything for emergency use should not use nylon to hold the steps.
3,Cate Tiernan's final books,"As with Night Child, Cate Tiernan's final book was a flop. You can really get into this book about Clio and Thais finding out what they want to do with their life, but when it comes to the end.... I felt that Tiernan was just ready to wrap everything up yet leave questions in case she felt like writing a fifth book...which the fourth is suppose to be the final..."
4,Autopsy-- Old School Death,"i was informed to check out Autopsy from a few fellow Heavy Music enjoyers quite some time ago and i have to say, from a Death Metal perspective, its a classic.one thing that i enjoy about older DM is how slapstick comical (granted GORY slapstick) the song titles can be [i.e. Charred Remains, Disembowel, Embalmed, Ridden With Disease].musically, very simple, fast and heavy. twas cool reading the liner notes and seeing Steve DiGiorgio [Sadus, Testament] played the session bass. production, about as unpolished as one could expect hah. one of the telltale signs of being an Old School Death Metal album.its a fun listen to say the least. for the sake of history its worth picking up and seeing where the DM subgenre came from."
5,Star Ocean EX - Continent (Vol. 5),"This is the 5th disk of the 6 disk series of Star Ocean EX. This disk continues the storyline of Claude and Rena's search for the Sorcery Globe. They will encounter more people and challenges as they progress towards and finally meet their destination, the Continent of El. The 5th disk certainly lives up to the name of the series. After completing this disk, I eagerly waited to watch the final disk to see the conclusion."
5,Additional hidden feature in this model not available w/ digital versions,"This is a great, high quality micrometer. The recessed body lets the head get right against an edge to measure.Best part about this model, and why I prefer it over the digital micrometers, is that these tend to disappear far less often. Coworkers will look at it, scratch their heads, and put it down and go look for a digital micrometer to steal. That and no batteries to replace ever."
5,Perfect?,After using a brown and sharpe this one feels much better. It is very accurate. I am using it for my engine rebuild and I get repeat measurements to the .0001!
2,Combinatorial Optimization,"This is a book for mathematic nerds. There are no practical analytical problems in the book to make it useful for those of us involved in quick solutions to solve problems such as payoffs for investments beginning with forces of nature and then going through probability factors to get to real numbers of what can happen to various investment opportunities.I did recognize the value of the book for those who are on the front lines of determining how many and where ISPs might be on a route from Edmonton to Washington but one can use other methods of project controls. The math in this book was of no value --- even a wee bit.When I came across the TSP or Travelling Salesman Problem, it reminded me of how I used to name physics problems for students. But, I always thought the TSP was really the Farmer's Daughter problem. Apparently it ain't so.JR."
2,Could it get anymore DISCRIPTIVE?,"It was sickening, the amount of details used in this short book. I have three words that explain my opinion on all of that unnecessary junk... I DON'T CARE! I don't care how exactly their water looked or how exactly the pioneers stored their food. I just want to know about Willow and her quest to survive. That's why I bought the book for goodness sakes! Not to read a textbook on pioneer life! If the author is so obsessed with putting those details in, the least she could do is put them in in an interesting way. I know these books are supposed to take place in just one day, but one day just doens't work for the Oregon Trail. The only thing I liked was that Willow was a pretty good character in that she was terrified of the river for a reason and in her feelings about her stepfather. But, I mean, where was the stinking survival in the book? WHERE?"
4,Sulpur Soap with Lanolin,"It arrived in a timely manner and in great condition. I'm not pleased with the smell of sulphur, but that can not be helped. They did the best they could to disguise the smell. Overall, it is good and works appropriately. I gave it only 4 stars, due to the sulphur smell...which is not all that offensive."
5,Great book!,"This book is outstanding! Once again another great book needed for my U.S. Military History class. Even though it is a historical book, it is written more like an actual story. Gives a good depiction of a bushwhackers lifestyle."
3,Negative Book,"This book was very negative. I know people sometimes need that, but I was looking for reasons TO have children, not reasons why I shouldn't. I already know all the reasons why I shouldn't. In the book she states some people feel that children are a lot of responsibility without a lot of rewards. That's exactly how perceive it to be. I wanted help trying to see the REWARDS. This book did not show any of them. So, since this book was so one-sided, I am still looking for help to show me the rewards of children."
1,Don't Bother,"Sadly, the author of this book presents herself as an authority in the baby-decision making realm. And in some ways, she may be, having been a family therpist for over 35 years.However, this single woman tells us in the introduction that she made a decision *not* to have a baby after asking herself the questions she asks of the reader in her book. So she does not possess the authority and insight of one who's been not only through the decision-making process, but also ultimately baby-bearing process.What does comes across is her belief that almost no-one is capable of being a good parent, especially if one were to follow her guidelines. For example, in order to be a good parent, in this author's opinion, one must have enough money not just for clothing and food, but also for summer camp, vacations, dance lessons, and private school. This, in addition to being an unrealistic expectation, is simply classist and highly inappropriate.Don't waste your time trying to work with this book."
1,Pretty awful,"My brother bought this game a couple years ago. I think we played it once. Since then it's been on the shelf collecting dust. Even if you are a LOTR fan (even if you are a super LOTR fan) I would not recommend this game. The riddles are straight out of the book, so if you have read the hobbit or seen the movie, the riddles are a joke. The song part is really dumb too. You just repeat after another person after they read the song. I can't even remember the other parts of the game. Buy LOTR Risk, that's a really decent game."
5,Classic!,"This is the same version that my parents read to to me every Christmas Eve growing up, I love it. The artwork is awesome...and the story, of course, is classic. I was so happy to find this exact version to share with my own children. I'm sure we will be reading it for years to come!"
2,THIS MOVIE IS NOT LIKE THE REST.......,WOW what happened? this has to be the second worst hellraiser movie! it barely has anything to do with hellraiser....very disappointing.....hellraiser deader was the absolute worst!!!!hellraiser is my absolute favorite horror series and the last two do not stack up at all!!!
3,Hellworld,"Hellraiser Hellworld....The movie was ok. it wasn't terrible. it was ok. The reason for this is that I like the way each Hellraiser is different. Yes it is like a teen slasher movie and I like the way Hellraiser original, Hellbound, inferno, and Hellseeker keep to a similar Hellraiser form, but Hellworld was entertaining to me. I look at this way. This series has 7 sequels, it has stayed alive for this long, and at least we get to see some decent kills at the hands of Pinhead. I do hope that the next sequel will return to the original hellraiser formula. As For Hellworld it wasn't terrible but it wasn't great. That's my review."
1,I Would Rather Go To Hell Than Watch This Again,"Hellraiser: Hellworld is definately the worst Hellraiser film to date. Hellraiser: Special Olympics would have been a better title. The plot is pathetic, the dialogue is awful at best, as is the acting. By the time a franchise gets to part 8, it's expected to be crappy but this film opens up it's own puzzle box of crappiness. I can't believe the money that is wasted producing horrible movies these days. Hellraiser 8 only solidifies my opinion that the entertainment industry has gone to Hell. Freddy Vs. Jason, Alien Vs. Predator, Hellraiser 8, what are they thinking? Are there any artists left in Hollywood?"
3,HOWS THAT FOR A WAKE UP CALL?,"The movie had a really good plot, and wasnt really like the Halloween movie at all. It seemed to mesh two different stories into one film and it balanced well for the most part. The final scene with Pinhead is always the best, even if the movie isnt great. Just remember the title of the review after seeing it."
2,not like Hellraiser 1 and 2,"I have been waiting for a film like Hellraiser 1 and 2 . But the good old times are over. This movie is like many movies part 1 is very good part 2 is also very good but then the quality is going down. I have now all parts from 1 to 8 ; but after part 4 the quality has changed.Better buy Part 1 and 2 ! Okay for collecting you must have all, but do not hope you get the HELL like before."
3,"Oh come on, its not THAT bad...","You really can't blame Rick Bota for his last 3 Hellraiser installments. After all, he manages to add a true air of creepy grittiness and nice visuals despite miniscule budgets and overall lame scripts.That being said, the screenplay to the 8th Hellraiser installment is far from a continuation of the original Clive Barker concept from the first 2 (or 4, if you're generous) movies. In order to halfway enjoy this movie you have to go into it expecting a typical slasher horror flick. Once you accept that, the movie is decent considering its budget.One reviewer said that there was nothing redeemable about this movie - I disagree. 3 stars for the smoking hot chick that leads one of the dudes to his doom. ;)"
1,s*&t world more like it,"This movie makes even Halloween: Resurrection look like a horror classic. By far the worse Hellraiser movie ever. It does not even deserve to be called Hellraiser cause it has nothing to do with the movies. Deader was crap but this is below that by some margin. After watching the first 4 parts of the franchise again,i only felt anger over this one. Either bring back Hellraiser as we knew it in the 80's or kill it off"
1,What The Hell?,"This movie is an utted disgrace to all horror movies and especially Hellraiser, the plot sucked, the actors and the acting sucked and worst of all Pinhead was only in the movie for a whole 5 minutes. They should this crappy movie in the garbage, get rid of all the a**holes who were in this movie and start over with Clive Barker making the movies. As soon as Clive left the movies really started to suck. Please next Hellraiser movie make sure Clive Barker is directing it and Peter atkins is writing the script cuz these people just plain out suck!"
5,Great book!,"This was one of the greatest books I have ever read. I enjoyed it far more than I expected, it sucks you in and won't let you go until you are finished with the book."
3,Over rated novel of Jews in Amsterdam of 1659,"The author does a wonderful job evoking the setting of Amsterdam in 1659. Miguel Lienzo, a Portugese Jew and trader on the commodities exchange, has entered into a partnership with Gertuid, a widowed Dutchwoman. They are set to corner the market on coffee, which is just becoming known as a drink to evoke the mind, rather than dull it the way alcholic beverages do.It is a novel of repressed longing, misdeeds and the Jewish community of Amsterdam. The protagonist is haunted by his past and is harassed by the ""parnass"" of his synagogue. Amazingly little to do with coffee, and mostly to do with Jewish persecution within it's own community. Not as good as the author's first novel, and much over rated."
4,I love coffee!,"Having recently visited the coffee-growing region of Chiapas, Mexico, we were interested in the further history of this wonderful beverage."
2,A Tantalizing Disappointment,"Reading this historical novel is like going to the bakery, picking out a mouthwatering pastry, and finding it tastes like cardboard. The historical background seems well researched, the characters initially seem to be interesting, the plot promising. But read on, and you will only be disappointed by the shallow portrayal of the life at that time, the undeveloped characterizations, and the excessively twisted and, ultimately baffling, plot. Why did Liss bother? In this material, there is a very good novel. The Coffee Trader is not it. Maybe someone else should give it a try."
3,A painful read,"Like many here I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the machinations of the varied characters. As much as I enjoyed the characters, however, I was left feeling the more interesting ones were pushed into secondary roles: Geertruid Damhui or Alferonda, for instance. The book should have been about them. Joseph Conrad or Cormac McCarthy may have found the jewels of insight that were lacking here.I found the book painful to read. Just when I thought nothing worse could happen, it would...with cups of salt rubbed in. Humanity has no redemption (except maybe some of the errant women). Perhaps that is true, but it doesn't make an enjoyable read."
3,Hmmmm...It's something you have to be in the mood for,"I am a huge fan of Emperor and Mayhem. Before I purchased this album, I knew very little about Darkthrone except that they played all-out no frills black metal. I was excpecting a raw, brutal CD when I popped this one in. There's very little to say about this release. Darkthrone, Marduk, and Burzum to a lesser extent have done this raw, brutal thing to death. This is a CD that anyone who has a craving for primitive, hyperspeed black metal needs for their corpsepainted little selves. For people new to the genre, I reccomend something else. Darkthrone fans will love this, but I'll save Soulside Journey for one of those days where I crave mindless speed and brutality."
4,An entertaining swashbuckler,"Although a little thin in the mystery department, A Famine of Horses presents us with an interesting, entertaining character, authentic-seeming details of Elizabethan life, and lots of action. Sir Robert Carey arrives in the borderlands of England/Scotland to take on the job of Assistant Warden and has to cope with a jealous rival, a funeral procession lacking horses, a dead body with dangerous, revengeful relatives, and the arrival of his lady love--married, of course. How Sir Robert solves both mysteries, of the disappearing horses and the body, makes a fun read that you want to gallop through to the end! I have never read any of this series before and am looking forward to more."
1,No NO NOOOOO,"nothing here but photo montages to songs, and not even crisp photos, they've been altered and are black and white. old footage of 'round and round' in 1984 on an LA station, but altered to look bootleg. it goes on and on! even actual concert footage is not good, you'll be watching an Arcade concert and it skips out halfway through the song. btw, who shot the video for 'in like pink' c'mon SEP I could have done soooo much better for you!! just go to youtube and search for ratt, arcade, sep, etc"
2,Okay While it Lasts,"This is a handy product to have around, especially with the suction cup accessory to hold it upright in your sink. But the sponge is too flimsy to do much beyond glasses or very superficial mess, and the green scrubby portion of the head falls off within a few washes. Definitely not the best dish brush I've used."
4,Do the dishes!,"Nice. I use it everyday. It works on the dishes, glasses and for lite cleaning on the pots. A nice lttle gadget. Buy the replacement heads too.Durable it will last."
4,Great White : Live and Raw,"This was for sure raw.After recently seeing Great White in concert, i needed to have a live concert of them.Since this seemed to be one of the only ones around i bought it.Despite other reviews not happy with it i was expecting not a very good DVD.This was for sure as if someone in the show had their own camera and took a video.It does not meet todays technical dvd's,but this concert was from the 90's.Based on that it was a good concert with their hits songs. I was happy with the purchase"
5,will shop from here aging!,"Great shipping and service, product was as stated and in perfect condition when it arrived! 5 stars"
1,Strong soapy scent...not appealing,"Don't get me wrong...i LOVE JLO's perfumes but this one is a miss! It smells like a cheap hotel soap and is overpowering. If you are looking for a great scent try her ""Live"" perfume which smells amazing. I wear it daily and gets compliments all the time.Stay away from Glow...unless you were an exclamation fan back in the 80s."
3,Nice but not great,This perfume is nice but does not smell like my type of perfume...it is a clean smelling perfume but I perfer perfumes that smell more floral...if you like clean smelling perfumes that smell like soap this if for you!
2,"Like the show, but Limited Questions and Slow Loading","Let me say that I love trivia games, and I still love watching Who Wants to be a Millionaire on the tube. As for the playstation game though I have to say this. First of all the game has a very limmited variety of questions that start to repeat after only a few plays of the game making it bore to play after only a couple of days. Number two, this game could not load more slowly from question to question, its like sitting and waiting for your death. I can get a right answer and wait a full minute untill Regis is reading the next question, its just so slow you will want to scream. My advice, watch this one on the tube, leave the playstation game alone though. Try You Dont Know Jack on your computer or Playstation instead. Its a better triva game suited for at home play with pals."
2,Not the best of games....,"First of all, I don't know why this game has a 2 player option. Two people face off and only 1 person gets to play the game really. Some of the face off questions are so ridiculously hard that you will be guessing for a long time and the game will keep on telling you to try again and again before ending the game. It won't even give you the right answer at the end!! You should have the option to pass to a new question for the faceoff.In the game, now this is where the playstation is showing it's age. The loading speed is VERY ANNOYING. The questions are repetitive after awhile. The phone a friend dialogues are amazingly cool and funny. Regis adds a few wise cracks and you got a less than average game. Not worth buying but go for a rental."
3,surprisingly low quality of illustrations,"It would make a great companion volume to the previous Jim Moran' book if not the poor quality of illustrations, especially modern recreations. 'Modern' photographs are (at least most of them) small sized and not quite 'sharp', uniformed models and details of equipment blend into the background. There are no color illustrations at all. Quite disappointing..."
4,Sure to please!,"I picked this up new and have not watched it yet. It features performances from The Lefevre Quartet, The Chuckwagon Gang, Lulu Roman, The Rambos, The Nelons(featuring Kelly Nelon Thompson), The Downings, The Speers, The Hinsons, The Lewis Family, A tribute to the Cathedrals, and The Singing Americans (featuring Michael English). Sure to please anybody who loves Southern Gospel Music."
3,Low paper weight,"In a rush I bought these envelopes to use for photo greeting cards. The paper weight of these envelopes is low so you can see the enclosed photo and written message through the envelope. Not really top-notch, but serviceable. Now that I know how thin the paper is, I will not buy these again."
1,Amazon's questionable business practice,I would imagine it would be spectacular if Amazon would deliver what I paid for
5,Brooks writing is better than ever.,"I've been a fan of Terry Brook's Shannara books since they first came out in the late 70's. The most common criticism that Terry has stayed ""complacently"" in the old groove is perhaps true on one level, BUT what they don't always mention is that Terry's writing has moved forward in subtle ways with each new trilogy. His story telling is masterful and always enjoyable."
5,Adventurous Page Turner,"This book is a smooth read. The next generation along with some of the previous generation make great traveling companions. Lots of action as well as magical beings. This book is a spectacular start for the new series. It's a more colorful story and even better written than the previous series. After just coming from reading Terry Goodkind's new story (Naked Empire), what a breath of fresh air. It's a fantastic feeling when you can look forward to the next book in a great series!"
2,Jarka who?,"As an avid fan of Terry Brooks from the beginning,I find it hard to believe he authored this book. The plot is predictable, dialogue on the sixth grade level, and the vivid descriptive writing of his previous books is missing. I know this is Book 1 of a series, but I expected so much more than what I got.Get it from the library- I did. Not worth rereading."
5,Awsome movie,"Scarry movie made the old fashioned way.No sex, no gore. Just plain scarry. Well done. Hope to see more like it."
1,couldn't make it through,"This movie was incredibly irritating. I understand that the lines were not scripted and that it was based on improvisation, but all the actors speaking over each other nonstop made this unwatchable for me."
3,Good till about the last 10 pages,"I had heard good things about this book so I was anxious to read it. I really wouldn't consider it a mystery, more of a fiction type of book. It started out really well and about halfway into it, I thought I had figured out what happened. But towards the end, it all fell apart. The ending felt rushed compared to the rest of the book and the way it ended kind of left you hanging. What I thought happened did not, but I almost wish I was right compared to what really occurred. There is a very disturbing plot twist right at the end that caught me by surprise. I was disappointed in the ending and I'm not really sure if I would read the next one in the series."
1,The Cities - enough already,"I am way behind all of the other reviews, and I read this book roughly 6 years after everyone else, and thank heavens I did NOT buy it but borrowed it, I have read all of the bad reviews and they are right on, I would like to add just one more little tidbit in to the horrible writing style, did any one count the number of times she threw ""the cities"" into a sentence? Have I missed something in life here about ""the cities"" I mean really if she used the term once she used it 30 times at least, please tell me there was a point to this.... I gave it one star simply because it wouldn't allow me to leave it without..."
4,Courage in Africa,"If the only thing you ever knew about Stanley and Livingstone was the famous phrase ""Dr. Livingstone, I presume"", but would really like to know the underlying story and enjoy a truly remarkable adventure, this is a great book to read. Livingstone had spend his career in Africa and was probably one of the most famous white explorers of his time, having walked across Africa in the first half of the 19th century. He returned when he was older to find the source of the Nile. He became ill and lost, and many presumed he was dead. The most amazing, exciting and improbable part of the story is Stanley, a complete unknown, who showed resourcefulness and courage as a correspondent on assignnment by the New York Herald. He was sent to find Livingstone and ""scoop the story."" You will be amazed and on the edge of your couch when you learn how he did it by overcoming disease, insects, tribal warfare, and impassable jungle."
1,Incredibly slow-paced,"This 3rd book from the Bren Cameron series is actually worse than the first two from the series. The diplomatic minutia reaches stifling heights, making the book virtually unreadable... I ended up having to skim the last third of this book - and I NEVER do that (I read about 4 books a month).Working my way through this book reminds me of when I was a kid, and was made to force down food I didn't care for... sure it was edible, but it wasn't enjoyable.There are just too many good science fiction books out there to deal with the sluggish pace found here... and I've still got three more books from this series to go!"
3,Outdated,"Overall, this is a useful chart for teaching children about the digestive system. However, the food pyramid is outdated. Time for an update of this product."
4,Standard stuff from this band is another's masterpiece,"First of all I guess this band had to change thier name to Banished (?) after this came out, but that's just here so you can hear more from these dudes. Why? Because you will want to after you listen to this slab of meat. Some of the best, no-frills guitar distortion that NEVER varies in the world of '90's death metal, this band wins the gold medal. NOT ONE guitar solo, but you won't miss 'em, becuse Inherit the Dead is a riff vault, catchy as hell, and the vocals are so low (without sounding gurgly) that you'll swear he's belching. Streaks of Blood was my all-time faviorite song on this release, and I hope you can find a copy with the lyrics because they are sick. For fans of early Deicide, Grave, Entombed, Necrophobic, Immolation, Deceased, Morgoth. Not exactly a technical knock-out, but so riff filled, and almost EVERY RIFF is bad ass and crusty. I loved it when it came out and I still love it now!"
5,Kudos for Kuo,Kuo's tale draws you into the world of Internet mystique and ten figure dreams no matter what your background is. All the stuff you wanted to know about the .com revolution drawing on everything you already did. A fantastic read-
5,Bosch Does it Again,"The Bosch CS20 is the best circular saw I've ever used. It has power to cut through the toughest jobs. The direct connect cord is best explained by - ""why didn't someone think of this before?"" The hook hangs the saw perfectly on rafters, joists, and saw horses. This saw is light and tough. This saw is sturdy and extemely well made. The final selling point is that it bevels to 56 degrees. This saw is the whole package."
5,The New Testament: An American Translation,This is a very good translation of the New Testament. It is an easier read than the King James version. And the translation of words are very accurate.
1,BEARING SECRETS---I GUESS I MISSED IT!!!!!!,"Based on the other review I guess I missed it on this one. I really liked The Innocents so I bought the rest of the Wil Hardesty series. Boy, do I wish I had not. If you do decide to read Bearing Secrets be sure to have a pen and paper in hand and write down each character and how they relate to the book. You will need this as it is very confusing. I don't think I have ever read a book that I stayed so lost with the people in it. It goes back seventeen years and brings you up to date. There are just so MANY PEOPLE and groups involved. I ended up reading several pages twice to try to connect who was who. I guess I will read the next one as I already have it and hope it is like the first one and not the second."
4,Still a good series,"We do not have Tivo or DVR...so for us this was still a good buy. My Son loves LE and we have their other 2 DVDs also. Until I get DVR, this is still a good product if your children enjoy LE (even though Disney is a rip-off)."
4,Margaret Cho is a Genius,She is like a ray of hope in the dark discriminative world. When I watch Margaret Cho I get the courage to be what i want to be.I love you Margaret and I hope you keep bringing the light into our lives.
5,"classic and pure ""Pooh"" perfection","i love this cd! it is my favorite pooh cd. i would recommend this cd to anyone. it has a beautiful, classic-ly pooh sound. each song is played and sung to perfection. you'll find it to be a very irresistable, energetic and passionate performance caught on an album for all posterity to enjoy. if you want to rock on with pooh, then i urge you to buy this cd! don't wait, do it now."
1,Not a good instruction dvd,"This is not a good instruction dvd for spinning in my opinion and experience. First off, the instructor should be on a bike, not appearing during the workout in sunglasses and yell at the participants. You can't hear the music at all and all the instructor's instruction was not comprehensible for even a trained person in exercise physiology let alone a beginner exerciser. I would not recommend this dvd."
4,A solid game.,"NCAA Gamebreaker 2001 is a solid game, and it is much improved over last year's title. I found this to be more fun than EA's rehash, and I really like playing it. Casual fans will probably enjoy NFL GAMEDAY 2001 more, but being a college football fan, I really enjoyed what is here."
4,The thinking of the master,"I already received and this product is very good. I suggest for all people interest in politics, arts and philosophy"
1,exploring psychology,"never received the book, and when i contacted the seller he didnt respond back. He ripped me off end of story."
2,too hard,"Our cat sleeps in the basement and the nights had gotten pretty cold, so I ordered this item, not realizing itwas made of hard plastic. Somehow I had envisioned something more along the lines of a hot-water bottle.It stays warm alright, but I'm going to switch to an electric heating pad for my aging cat's comfort."
2,Didn't last 24 hours,"My dog LOVES heat so I thought this would be perfect to put in her cage while we are at work. I buried it underneath the blankets, and had the blue cover over it. She ripped off the blue cover and chewed all the way around the warmer, and punctured it so I can't use it at all.Now I'm stuck with the blue cover, paw print cover, and dog stuffed animal.The warmer is a lot harder than I thought it was, so I can see how some dogs wouldn't find it very comfortable to lay on, but if you use the stuffed animal the heat doesn't go through it very well.The one good thing is I was surprised at how long it stayed warm."
5,snuggle safe,"This item worked very well when trying to keep animals warm,without having to plug it in, it's safer then a heating pad."
3,I wish I had researched this better...,"I was not aware this item was hard disk based on the description, and remained hard after heating. I'm sure it would work well for others, but my cat was suspicious of his bed anytime I had it under his cushion. Unfortunately, it added too much bulk, like a mound due to the small size. I never used the cover it came with because my pet doesn't like anything that doesn't have a familiar feel or scent to it. I must say the disk does heat up well, and not too hot to touch, which is good. I'm looking for a softer heating pad that plugs into an outlet, and covers a wider area that won't put my kitty on a hill when he sleeps. Not sure how much luck I'll have, but I'm trying."
4,IT DOES WHAT IT SAYS!,"I was hesitant. It does work. I had to figure out the wattage on my microwave first, as it warns you not to over heat it. Aside from it being hard as a rock, it does work - I heated at 10pm and it was still warm at 9 am. Not too warm - comfortable. I placed under a pillow that was not too thin or thick, so the heat could be felt. My dog slept comfortable. I also order a separate cover but it alreadly came with one. Does what it says just wish it was softer."
5,Great for keeping feral cats warm,"This is a wonderful product. I wish it was not so expensive, when you have a colony of feral cats more than one has to be purchased. But I am so thankful for this product. Thank you"
4,"Small and rigid, but it really works great","There is a stray that has taken residence in my backyard long before I moved in. I have other cats that would not take well to me taking her in, and quite frankly - I think she'd be miserable. However, I couldn't rest unless I knew she had a warm place to sleep on cold nights. The SnuggleSafe Heating Pad is BY FAR the BEST product I have come across to keep her toasty and safe. She has a little house outside and all I have to do is heat it in the microwave and put it under her blanket at night and she's happy and warm.Pros: No power outlet neededStays warm for hoursEasy to heat and placePeace of mind that she's warmCons: Hard as a rock (I put a fluffy/furry pet blanket over it to soften it up)You don't need to buy the extra cover that is advertised since it already comes with oneOnly good for small animalsI HIGHLY recommend this product,"
4,Kill Bob,"Stick with this 70s crime curio. The tense, violent second half will have you on the edge of your seat as you ponder -- ""Sydney Pollack directed this?"" Great performance by Takakura Ken."
5,"Fast delivery, awesome movie","Great movie, with a deep storyline but not too difficult to follow. If you are interested in organized crime movies mixed in with a little culture. If you are a gamer i suggest also lokking at the Playstation 2 games of Yakuza and Yakuza 2 as a compliment for the movie."
5,Great Series---read the others!,I have enjoyed this series and particularly like this one as it gives alot of details about Scotland...
5,Wonderful!,Another great Gabaldon! Lots of interesting insider info. So very much looking forward to the newest book in the Outlander series!
3,Companion,"THE OUTLANDISH COMPANION is a fan's handbook that is as engaging as the series it details. Diana Gabaldon's expert early computer skills, Google did not exist when she started writing the Outlander series. She was working with scientific data.The horoscopes were drawn by a fan and make fascinating reading, you wonder if Diana will use any of the information as character points. Tempe ting for a writer but shaky for a scientist.The dictionary (glossary) could be stronger, but I know the problems with that one. What is obvious and what is necessary are vital questions.Read the stories, then the companion and hope there will be a second companion when the series is complete.Nash Black, author of WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and SINS OF THE FATHERS."
3,Dissappointment in content,"I'm dissapointed in the new reference type book for several reasons: There are no explanations or sketches of the costumes of the period. What exactly are ""breeks"" anyway? Very few drawings of the geographical areas. The glossary is not alphabetical! How can one look up a word or phrase if you have to page through the whole glossary -- not very helpful while you are reading the books. I was hoping for help in understanding or relating to the times. I was not interested in a detailed horoscope of two fictional characters. I'd rather have had drawings of the characters and a lot more hard fact about the period.It is an interesting book. Just not quite what I expected."
3,"New York, I love you",I should have rented it first and then decide to buy later but I really did not care the story behind the title. Great condition and fast service. If you buy this rent it first.
1,Worst movie ever.,Oh....<snooze>....my......<snooze>......gawd......<snooze>. The most boring movie ever! I've officially wasted one hour and twenty six minutes of my life watching a series of short stories that don't tie together.
3,The capital of smooching,"A rather silly little film. It is in no way love for the city of New York which is hardly explored or presented, except as a hunting ground, but evanescent and transient love in New York. Nothing really regular, only accidental meeting and sexual exchanges that are more at the level of the word, not really courting but rather shocking in order to get the fastest and most comprehensive reaction that has to be sexual action. A couple of situations are funny, but never very kosher and that leads to a mutilated vision of New York with only Jews and Chinese. Rejection of the others and stigmatization of those shown. A film to avoid if possible or to see in order to learn the art of the caricature that means nothing.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 CrÃ©teil, CEGID"
1,Mutilation of a Classic,"Just a response to another reviewer; yes, this is Clair's 1950 recut of the film. But the recut is ill-advised, and is generally considered by most historians as a prime example of someone far removed from the circumstances of the film's actual production butchering their own work.Is this the 1931 classic, intact, as Clair originally intended?No, it is a recut, which most critics feel strongly is a disgrace.Do NOT buy this DVD; get the uncut version on VHS while you still can. Once again, Criterion should have restored the original version, rather than presenting this cut version; anything less violates entirely the spirit of the original film."
3,Of historical interest,"Sound quality is pretty bad. The background music comes through fairly well but the dialogue varies from comprehensible to zilch. And, of course, it helps to understand French (I do). All that said, the photography is pretty good. The images of the company factory/society(?) as a prison are quite striking, albiet dated. Not for the weak of heart or casual viewer. It certainly captures a particular view of industrialization and dehumanization fairly common in Europe during the 1920's and 1930's. Important for serious students of cinema/history."
4,cute,These cards are cute but this collection isn't as nice as some of the others with images on both sides. Still a great buy.
1,"obviously not ""new""","Although the box was sealed in plastic, the cards inside were not new. A couple of the cards are smeared with something brownish, possibly soda (?). This is not acceptable, considering these should've been new cards."
2,"Way, way overpriced","The cards are large, sturdy, and well drawn. Each animal has its name on the back in a nice cursive font. But there are only SIX cards in the box!!! At $12.95 per set, I should at least get enough cards to fill the Wee Gallery mobile. I would prefer twice the number of cards at half the thickness, since I don't intend to let my daughter gnaw on them. Come on!"
4,"Beautiful, but wish they were laminated","I got these before my daughter was born and used them with her from the beginning. There is no doubt that the first few months they really captured her attention. And I think the designs are just beautiful. I do wish that I could have found a mobile hanger that would allow the cards to hang horizontally so that she could look up at them, instead I've only found ones that hang vertically, making it almost impossible for her to see the designs.Now that she is 6 months, all she wants to do is put things in her mouth and it would be nice if these were laminate so I could give them to her to play with. I've framed them and they look nice, and will take them out to see if she is interested in them when she is a little older."
5,Gameday Rocks Madden!,"Gameday is a the best football game on the market. Plain and simple. Its gameplay is killing maddens, flat out. Gameday specializes in head to head games making them amazingly fun and stragetic. Unlike boring madden where the game is based off of playing the computer, gameday excels in gameplay and head to head action!"
2,Get Madden,"Gameday is an ok arcade game, but Madden tears it to pieces. Gameday has no where near the graphics Madden has, and Madden offers a more realistic game playing. In gameday a tiny HB can drag a DE for 5 yards. It is very similar too last years model."
2,Not an Improvement,"This game is near identical to Gameday2000. Same music, same sound, same plays. The graphics managed to get worse, somehow. They tried to make size and speed more of a factor, but it didn't work well. Having current rosters is the only advantage.I have owned every Gameday title, and loved every one. They always seemed to bet better and better. This version was such a step backward that I had to laugh. It was like the developers forgot they were supposed to make it, and threw together this version in a few days.If you have Gameday2000, don't bother getting this."
2,very dissapionted,I had never bought a 989 football game before and i wish i hadnt bought this one. The graphics are horrible it looks like I'm playing on a super nintendo. If you're planning on buying this game I suggest you wait until you get a Playstation 2 because that's the only way the graphics will be better.
3,outdated information,"This guidebook ""walks"" a tourist through London. The walking tours are informative and a delight to read. I benefitted by using this guidebook on my May 2004 trip.However, the book lacked three essential components that would make it as my single source guidebook. There were 1) no color coded map of the tube, 2) no overlaying the underground station names with the walking maps and 3) the incorrect hours of operation at many of the main attractions."
5,My 1st opera!,"This is the first opera I have ever listened to in it's entirety. Have never been a fan. But I happened to get the Opus Arte sampler and heard the selection from the Queen of the Night and was so moved I bought the blu-ray version of the entire opera. I am not disappointed. I love all the singing, the set and staging. The sound quality, which got me here in the first place, is stunning. Bluray is the newest hi-res reference sound and will hopefully accomplish what SACD and DVD-Audio didn't; mass market education and demand for hi-res, video and audio. I am looking froward to sharing with my daughters, 8 & 12. We'll see. Kudos to all involved."
5,Mozart would be pleased,"This is simply an immensely enjoyable and timeless interpretation by Sir Colin and crew of one of the greatest operas ever created. What I love about this particular production, is not only the flawless performances, but the undeniable humor and playfulness of Mozart's deceptively simple but utterly powerful music and Schikaneder's ingenious libretto that often sends the audience into uproarious laughter. While the profound scenes and themes of Die Zauberflote are presented brilliantly and effectively (Dianna Damrau is truly incredible as the Queen of the Night), this cast doesn't take themselves too seriously. The caricature of Monostatos is hilarious! The sets and costumes are exquisite but not too much for your senses to appreciate. Any fan of Mozart or opera should buy this DVD as soon as possible and then get comfortable for a few hours pure musical and theatrical bliss!"
3,Yeah but what about all tailgators and bad drivers???,"This is all fine and good but what about the road racers, tailgaters and cellphoners?Isn't some of our Ire a reaction to stupdity???"
5,Excellent Book for any C# Developer,"If you've already written some code in C#, you have to buy this book. It is focused on coding, and its examples get right to the point by including only code on the topic at hand. Each item is clearly labeled in the table of contents and if you want to use it as a reference, it works for that, but it is easy to read from cover to cover, too. Don't make this your first C# book, but don't wait long after you write your first bit of C# code to make it yours.I am a critical reader of grammar and spelling, and (unlike a previous reviewer)I didn't find the grammar and spelling distracting."
3,A stylistic leap more than a forward motion,"Taking inspiration from the rock-n-roll of the 1950s put into a jaded postmodern retrospective in the style of the Misfits, yet in black metal, Darkthrone degrade social image into sadism and madness yet only succeed in aping the third Bathory album. Their next work rectifies this problem. While like anything from this era of the band this album is rendered by inspired genius, its organization and emotions do not come together to a lasting experience of listening."
3,An OK movie,"I had never heard of this movie until I ran across it on Amazon.com. I made the purchase because I like Gene Hackman in just about everything he does.This is a reasonably entertaining movie, but not great. Some of the more interesting things about it are seeing a young James Woods and seeing near nude shots of a young Melanie Griffith.I don't believe that I can honestly recommend that anyone purchase this movie because it is not one that would be watched many times. In fact, I believe I will donate this one to our local library. That way, this movie will be watched by folks that would not ordinarily purchase a copy."
2,y-a-w-n,"I watched this because I'm a Gene Hackman fan. Despite his (youthful) skill at developing a believable shamus, I couldn't get into the three intermixed, sluggish, low-action plots - Hackman's disinigrating marriage, the persuit of the missing girl, or the smuggling. If you've seen Gene in the French Connection, the Firm, or the Unforgiven, don't expect the same from this early work."
3,JUST OK,"Although much praised, I found this film to be just an average noir private eye film. The tape I had showed the photography to be lacking; some scenes were so dimly lit that you could barely discern the action. I believe Arthur Penn's direction is lacking too.It is a chance to see a young Melanie Griffith and James Woods though. Who would have thought at the time how well they would be paired up in the future in ""Another Day in Paradise."""
1,"Cheap, very uncomfortable",This is the most uncomfortable thing I've ever slept in - I woke up partway through the night and threw it across the room! The seams on the inside are NOT flat so they dig in and leave marks on you. The elastic around the bottom is both very thin and cheap and is unfaced on the inside so it is scratchy. The elastic around the shoulders is also not faced so it is scratchy. I think the only way this might be wearable at all is inside-out...as if it wasn't ugly enough to start with. Totally disappointed with this product!!
1,A waste of money,"Another reviewer stated that this bra might as well have been made of tissue paper and I completely concur. For anyone with a bust beyond A or B - and a band size outside of the typical 34-36 - this bra just doesn't provide any support or fit correctly. It rides up in the back and sags in front providing little to no support. Despite the improper fit, I did try to make it work, only to find that the elastic gave out after very few washings. Overall, a disappointment. Spend your money on another more ""constructed"" bra."
1,Are these sizes based on children!?,"This bra is absolutely not true to size. I ordered an XL and felt like I was trying to put on a training bra. Also, the quality is very poor."
1,Horrid Fit,"I read the reviews for this bra before purchasing it and didn't think I'd dislike it - I have a small frame, so I wasn't worried about the small fit that others have complained about.Not so.The real fit issue for me is that the straps don't adjust in length at all, making the bra too ""short"" for me - and my guess is that it would be too short for a lot of other women too.So although the band is comfortable, and I like the pull to the side aspect of this bra for nursing, the fact that it slowly rides up and eventually over my chest as I wear it means that it is unwearable."
1,doesn't wash well,"Unfortunately the quality of this product is poor -- the elastic edging started to unravel after the first wash! Also, the sizing runs small."
2,Comfortable before 1st wash,"This bra was very comfortable at first, but after the first wash, it shrunk horribly. I washed it on cold and did a gentle dry but it shrunk so much it's unwearable and I bought a size bigger"
2,Not a good fit for large-chested women.,"I suppose this would be sufficient coverage/holding power for small-chested women, but when I nurse I'm a 36DD+, and it was TERRIBLE. I returned it immediately as it did not cover or provide any sort of hold."
1,XL??,"I am a 40C so I purchased the extra large and it is way to small. I was falling out of it, it was extremely tight, and there was no way to adjust it."
2,needs thicker bust band,After washing the bra the band under the breast curls up. The bra also rides up in the back to compensate the weight in the front. It could be that I ordered the wrong size. I went by the recommendation. Target has a night one by Bravado (basics) that looks way more quality. When I get the extra cash I'll be getting this...
5,Great product at a great price,"I was a little worried after reading other reviews but this is a great bra. It never claimed to be a sports bra or push up bra and all I wanted was something to keep my chest up off my belly without tight elastic or wires. I'm still pregnant so I'm not sure how it will work when I'm engorged, but I can't see it suddenly becoming flimsy just because I gave birth. As for comments about the material, it's like an old cotton t-shirt or even just like a pair of old-fashioned white cotton panties. It is thin, and when you get cold it shows, but it's not marketed as an outside the house bra anyway. I wear this every day and sleep in it too. It's a great lounge bra."
5,My wife says it's great,I bought this bra for my wife who just gave birth to our son. She likes it very much and wants another one...so I'm buying a second one for her.
1,NO GOOD,"I BOUGHT THIS BRA SO THAT I CAN BREASTFEED A LITTLE EASIER @ NIGHT, IT WAS NOT WORTH IT. YOU CAN GO TO WALMART AND GET A BETTER BRA FOR A CHEAPER PRICE. IT IS NOT CONFRONTABLE, IT RUNS VERY SMALL."
3,OK,"Product was fine, didn't fit, returned it immediately; got credit but it tooklonger than I expected. Would use this seller again."
3,Not much support,"This bra is comfortable and fine for sleeping, but it has very little support. If you're getting it only to wear during sleep, it'll get the job done, it holds the breast pads against the breasts. But don't expect this bra to do anything for you while you're out of bed."
2,quality could be better,"Bra is pretty comfortable, but the quality is lacking. After first wash the hem started to unravel. Sizing seems to run a little small also - I am normally a 34 C. Went with the Large for nursing and seems like it is a little tight."
5,WIfe loved it,"My wife has worn several different bras but this by far was the most comfortable and she loved it. As mentioned before, they are slightly on the small side, but still very wearable - if you have larger bust then probably go for a size up.They are very thin and breathable, but that's why it's a sleep bra :)"
2,Terrible sleeping bra,I purchased 2 of these bras and I have to say that I do not like them one bit. The material is incredibly thin but the worst part is how high it rides up in my back. I am not big chested so it holds my girls in just fine but it drives me crazy how ridiculously high it goes on my back. I am forever tugging it down but it is as though the back is a size extra small and the front is a medium. I would NOT recommend this bra to others.
2,"Comfortable, but...","This bra is very comfortable and fits well, but I am disappointed that the printed label on the back has started sticking to my skin after only 4 months of wear."
3,Blah. Yet to find a nursing sleep bra I like...,"This bra is made of very thin cotton. I ordered the white one...I have an average frame, and while it fit well on my chest, the racer back kept riding up high so it was practically between my shoulders instead of centered on my back. While this bra is pretty comfortable, it's completely see-through and not absorbent at all. I, of course, wear nursing pads with it, but I also get pretty sweaty in my sleep with all these extra breastfeeding hormones, and I don't like waking up to damp boobs. I prefer the Lamaze bra, but that one isn't perfect either..."
3,Not the Best and Not the Worst Sleep Bra,"I agree with previous reviewers that this bra runs on the small side and that the fabric is thin. I also find that the elastic around the bottom is not the most comfortable. There are better sleep bras out there, including another made by Medela."
3,Maternity bra,"It got here within a decent amount if time. But after first wash, it began to fall apart. Not good."
2,already fallen apart,I was more than happy with the prompt delivery from the seller but the product itself I am not so impressed with. It has already started to fall apart on the bottom chest band elastic. It also was never as comfortable as my other sleep bra.
2,Not comfortable.,This bra is not comfortable to wear at night while nursing. There is no support and it moves a lot while you sleep. It is also not true to size and fits very tightly. Order a larger size then you normally wear if you order this bra.
4,Perfect for the granddaughter,"We bought this as a Christmas gift for our 1.5 year old granddaughter. Looks like it should be perfect for her. She loves stuffed animals. Our 3 year old grandson (her brother) will have fun with it as well, knocking the pins down."
4,Trick ball and cute soft pins,"I bought this toy for my son's first birthday. The toy is very soft and each pin makes a slightly different sound when knocked down. My only critique is that the ball does not go straight, but it is fun to see him play with it and it helps to teach him about different animals and hand coordination. Good purchase."
3,"It's OK, not my fave","I got this for my son's 1st birthday and he had absolutely no interest. As he got older, he wanted to play with the ball but never the ""pins"". Since he's turned two he is suddenly very interested in this toy. He knows the animal types and he likes to set the pins up and knock them down. When we play together I put them in a triangle and put a book on the floor a few feet away for him to stand or sit on as the ""do not pass"" line. When he plays by himself he just lines them up and throws the ball at them. He could do this for 30 minutes or more. The ball is a little wobbly, which makes hit hard to control, therefore difficult to hit the pins and, therefore, sometimes frustrating for kids (and parents!). Also, the bottoms of the pins can get bent easily and not stand up so well. I would probably not by this set again, primarily b/c of the ball, but like the concept of the game, the animal characters which can be educational, and the soft plush."
4,good but not great,"The ball and pins are soft and great for small kids to throw and ""body bowl"" with. My nephew has more fun with throwing the ball around the room and running into the pins and kicking/body bowling them down. The fact that it does not take batteries is a great plus."
2,The Kids Enjoyed it BUT...,"My children really enjoyed this toy but I really didn't think it was all that great. The only thing they enjoyed about it was the ball. They threw it around a lot.I couldn't get the animals to stand up right, EVER. It is not educational besides the pins are animals. Since the pins don't stand up though the kids don't really pay attention to them.I ended up giving this toy away to someone who had a baby. I thought maybe it would be better for a baby who is learning how to hold things since the game part just doesn't work."
1,Too many important bands excluded,"Well at least they put Kraftwerk and New Order on here, but besides them, they have forgotten many important electronic music pioneers such as: Devo, Gary Numan, Magazine, Pete Shelley, The Buggles, Ultravox, Visage, The Flying Lizards, and Soft Cell. A lot of these bands don't get enough credit for their innovation, so it really should be no surprise that Rough Trade would forget them as well. I just expected Rough Trade to be smarter than that since they were such a good record label back in the '70s and '80s, but I guess not."
3,Not bad and I did recognize a 'Parrothead' mate of mine but not up to: Margaritavision or Live by Bay,More of look at the backstage sideof Buffett show. Released beforeTales from Margaritavision. Mylate father would have liked tosee it.
2,Just OK,"I'm on child number 2 with this chair, and my complaints are the same. 1. They tray is way too high for an infant/young toddler to reach anything. My son is 8 months old and he can barely see what is placed on top of the tray.2. It is a cleaning nightmare. I am still finding food from my first born hidden in this chair!Good points:-pop off tray-divider that keeps them from slipping out-cool colorsI tried a friend's cheap Evenflo chair and I loved it 100 times better and it cost over 100 dollars less!"
4,"High quality, made in Italy","We've been feeding our baby in this since he was six months old, and while the tray is a little high, it was never a problem. It is very sturdy and should last through at least a few children.My only complaint is that we sometimes pull off the tray and put it on the floor with Cheerios, but the ""Peg Perego"" logo on the front of the tray rubs off very easily. It is almost like a lottery scratch ticket. Since baby lifts the tray when it's on the floor and puts his mouth on the tray, the logo ""ink"" could potentially be ingested. For this reason, I just rubbed off the logo.Otherwise, no complaints. Definitely not a travel highchair but with the addition of the Chicco Hippo, we have all of our bases covered."
2,Is it really worth the money???,"I don't think so. My son has been using this chair since he was 4 months old (he is 15 months old now) and I don't care for this chair too much. When I put the tray on I must shove the tray into the chair 2 or 3 more times to make it ""click"" into place. Otherwise one side of the tray is not properly locked in. (I must do this EVERY time; VERY annoying.) Also, the tan leather doesn't seem to be as ""pretty"" as when we first bought it; it looks kind'f grungy (sp.) now even though I clean it all the time.I do like the fact that the seat raises up and down and also reclines, but many of the cheaper highchairs do this as well.I will not be buying this chair for my 3 month old. Overall, for the money, I would not recommend this chair."
2,Poor mans Dead Poets Society,"When I saw the beginning of this film I thought for a second or two I had stumbled onto the best movie ever made,namely the majestic Dead Poets Society of which this is a very obvious & poor copy. The opening scene even goes on about the importance of honour in a 1950s prep school & some of the students/actors are dead(pun not intended!)ringers for the infinately better Dead Poets cast. With the exception of Matt Damon who is a fine actor. How do the people in hollywood get away with this?? Avoid this silly copy & buy Dead Poets Society & thank me later."
5,Murder on a train,"The third installment of the Phryne Fisher series 'Murder on the Ballarat Train' begins quite literally, with a bang, when Phryne decides to leave Melbourne with her trusty and reliable companion Dot, and travels by train leaving behind her beautiful, fast Hispano-Suiza. Some sinister plot is afoot and Phryne has to shoot out the window of a train compartment to save the passengers. Thus begins the highly amusing investigation into an old lady's murder and a child's background suffering from amnesia and now given into Phryne's care. As the previous books, the story is vastly entertaining and Phryne solves the cases with her usual flair and common sense. The cast of secondary characters is growing and they are immensely likable, as is the heroine. I would definitely recommend reading the series in their publishing order as each of the characters becomes more rounded and a full picture begins to build."
2,Murder on the Ballarat Train,"Dismally un-engrossing, with cardboard characters and an improbable plot. I was not drawn into this story and the characters did not seem real."
4,Enjoyable mysteries,The Phryne Fisher series is great fun and a good read. I enjoy the Australian setting and historical detail as well. Each one introduces different historical elements and while not great literature they are entertaining enough to keep me reading. A great series to read when traveling or just relaxing on vacation.
4,Female vocal jazz,"I am a huge fan of Diana Krall. When I heard Terrie, I got goosebumps! She has a very sultry, yet warm voice that melts me! I will be following her career and buying anything I can of hers! I also liked the simplistic array of instruments to keep the image tighter and more personal. Highly recommmended!"
1,A disappointing overview of what could be a cool subject.,"READ MY LIPS contains photos that are not much more exciting than your usual magazine fare, and a brief text which is surprising dry and even more surprisingly--dull. There is also some misinformation, regarding statistics, dates, and names. It would be nice to see a book on the subject that is more substansive and actually offers information we haven't heard before, written in a more exciting style. A disappointment."
1,Nothing for the serious minded fashion expert here.,"This is long love letter to lipstick, written with the aren't I cool? bravado of a magazine journalist. A tiresome read, with lots of giggly plays on words. For now, I'll stick to Allure, and In-Style."
5,The most believable Hamlet,"I teach Shakespeare classes to adults and have a personal collection of seven VHS and DVD versions of Hamlet. Campbell Scott is by far the most believable, and my students have chosen it as their favorite version. Claudius is pefect--a smiling smiling villain absolutely capable of secucing his sister-in-law and murdering his brother. The casting of Polonius, Ophelia and Laertes worked well. The second choice of my students is the Mel Gibson, which had been number one until they saw Campbell Scott. The scene in the room where they have stored away all reminders of the old king is brilliant. Great film."
1,very disappointing,"Ok, first off, what in the world is up with the bongos and other crappy background music? It just doesn't fit in with the Shakespearian play at all. I can understand perhaps using a little rock music if you want a bit of a modern twist, but the slow jazz music and cheap-sounding piano really downplay all the emotional scenes. The movie wasn't affecting at all. And some of the acting was really crappy. I couldn't feel any sparks between Hamlet and Ophelia and the last scene was so anti-climatic. The swordfight was made too light of a matter - it just seemed as though they were just practicing or entertaining the court. This was the first time I ever saw Hamlet acted out (I had to watch this for a class) and I really like the play, so I was highly disappointed. I swear, you could find more entertainment in just reading the orginal Shakepeare script than watching this."
4,Snap Crackle and Pop,"This is wonderfully fun pop album, a true gem. The songs are immediately infectious, as all good pop songs are. The edges are a little bit raw, which makes the album all the more charming. These guys and gals are having a good time with this one, and it shows.My only complaint is that the album loses a lot of momentum as it progresses. The first six tracks are sheer brilliance, but after that the more forgettable songs begin to kick in. The problem is as much with line-up as anything else. If the more boring songs weren't so clustered together they probably wouldn't seem as boring. As it is, I prefer to listen to the first six tracks, the real knock-outs, and then put something new in the stereo. Really, though, buy this just for the stellar first half. It's not like the bad songs are that bad, but they seem to pale in comparison.This music is loud, upbeat, rolicking; it makes you want to jump around. Especially perfect for sunny summer beach parties!"
5,Pop rock insanity,"Do the lyrics make sense? Maybe. Are they sung with the conviction that they make sense? Yes. Add to this, and more importantly, layers of pop-hook gorgeousness with organ, guitar, horns, everything, and both male and female lead vocals. This gives you a consistently great pop record (in the old school sense) that clearly displays influences without being derivative. A mix of Kinks, Cheap Trick, Beach Boys, maybe some Go-Gos, just a great, catchy record. Listen once and it is OK, listen twice and you have a problem taking it out of your CD player. A big, enjoyable problem. Absolute standout tracks are Mass Romantic, Letter from an Occupant, My Slow Descent into Alcoholism, and the Mary Martin Show."
4,a novel of conformity,"Sinclair Lewis is best known for his novel Main Street. But Babbitt is a fine novel. H.G. Wells said of it: ""I wish I could have written Babbitt."" It's a novel about George F. Babbitt and the city he lives in, Zenith. Some of the greatest lines in the book are descriptions of Zenith, not the least of which is the opening lines. Lewis creates in Babbitt the total conformist and we follow him through his conformity and into thinking on his own. Babbitt is simply a man who wants to be liked by everyone. Babbitt gives expression to the glibness and irresponsibility of the professional social climber. Lewis gives us one of our modern classics."
4,"Long, At Times Boring, But Somehow ""Interesting""","Basically I recommend this book which I ""read"" as a book on tape. The theme is ""a man's life""---and the ""emptiness of life""-------and the search for ""the meaning of life"". You may perceive certain aspects of YOUR life in the life story of Mr. Babbitt. Thus, you finish the book with the idea, ""Hey, this author understands me"".....""I'm not alone. ""Other people have intermittant feelings of ""meaningless of life"" and I'm not alone."" You probably will get ""bored"" with some long-winded passages but overall the book is worth reading. Don't expect any ""deep answers"" to the meaning of life. But, the book does have a ""satisfying"" ending. Email: boland7214@aol.co"
4,listento the rest of the reviews!!!,"i bought this because of the price! wow i cant be more satisfied! i would give it 5 stars but i had no use for the glue! if u buy this i suggest that u go to radioshack and get some fastener hook locks! there like velcro so you can put them up without damaging the wall! other than that, 10 stars!"
1,Do Not Buy At This Price,You can buy this toy from Toys R Us for 59.99. Save yourself some money and do not buy this toy for nearly 200.00.
5,TRACK LISTING:,"1. MUSICA ES - MUSICA E2. ASI SON LOS AMIGO - IN SEGNO D'AMICIZIA3. SOMOS DE HOY - UNO DI NOI4. COMPLETAMENTE ENAMORADOS - UN NUOVO AMORE5. POR TI ME CASARE - TI SPOSERO PERCHE6. Y ME REBELO - E MI RIBELLO7. NADA SIN TI - SOLO CON TE""MUSICA ES"" ES UNA COMPOSICION DE 11 MINUTOS QUE CONSTITUYE EL MOMENTO MAS REPRESENTATIVO DE LA CARRERA DE EROS RAMAZZOTTI EN LA ACTUALIDAD"
4,Italian rock,"Musica Ã¨ is the original Italian album and the 1991 blockbuster that followed his albums Cuori Agitati, Nuovi Eroi and In Certi Momenti. It's a strong collection of ballads and rockers that sold millions and created a place for Eurorock, a genre that can best be defined by referring to the music of Bryan Adams, for example: big singalong ballads and some rockier numbers, always very melodic. Strongest track here is La Luce Buona Delle Stelle which translates as The Good Starlight."
3,Not as good as I had anticipated,"I did get some things out of the book, such as how he explains the ""social engine"" process as a way to turn a company into a ""customer-centric company"". But on the whole, I felt there was a lot of repetition, and a lot of other stuff just seemed like good old common sense to me...I was a little disappointed."
2,Far removed from their earlier excellent work,"Don't change the pattern if it is working or at least go far away from what made you great - vocals, inspired tunes and dance hall music"
3,Cute but nothing special,I think there are much better plush toys for the money. My daughter had no interest and its cute just nothing great.
5,Cuddly and cute,Very soft and cuddly...perfect for a little one. My granddaughter keeps putting the soft toy next to her face. This is a winner.
4,Kung Fu Hustle,Good picture but sound cantonese just stereo not dolby digital or dts. Overall its a good movie. Dolby Digital just in english translate and its sound funny.
1,Unhappy!,Unfortunatly when I ordered this movie I didn't realize it was in the umd for psp format. I have not been able to contact Amazon or the sendor to do an exchange or refund. It is a shame because it came very quickly. It was my error on the order but it would be nice to be able to resolve the problem. In the future I will be very careful ordering to make sure I get the correct format.
2,Big mistake,"Wacky, stupid and overall unnecessary special effects. Great movie for kids that are 10, 11. If you're gonna do a kung fu movie, why do you have to involve fantasy elements? Why do they insist on doing this? I just don't get it. I admit its a pretty entertaining flick, but is not that great. Sorry, but Jackie chan is still number one."
1,"Great movie, Terrible access","By far one of the greatest martial arts movies of all time, but having the only viewing option as ""streaming"" , rather than being able to download and watch without pixelation from streaming, has convinced me to NEVER buy a movie through amazon again."
2,The Fu That Failed,"Kung Fu Hustle is a really cheezy movie, with a bunch of badly acted stereotype characters. The Voiceover work is horrible, and only barely can be interpreted as being the same dialogue as the subtitles show (and probably even worse from the original chinese).Despite claims to the contrary, it is not 'Crouching Tiger meets Looney Tunes'. The plot is nowhere as complex as a Bugs Bunny cartoon, there are scenes that seem to have nothing to do with the plotline at all, and some of the characters (especially the gay characters) are so ridiculously inslulting as to annoy me to an extreme. The Kung Fu was also pretty bad, the over use of wire work for humor side downright boring, and the reasoning behind what was going on even more ridiculous.There's a point where funny becomes ludicrous and unacceptable... where I lose interest and can't regain it. This movie went there."
5,Japanesse Comedy at it's best,This movie is hilarious. i love japansse comedies and this one takes the cake. I Recommend it for everyone
5,Excellent fun!,"I've been to see this movie three times so far, and it gets funnier and more enjoyable with each viewing. I am overwhelmed by the superb action sequences, the comedic timing, and the serious, touching undertones, all of which integrate to produce a truly wonderful experience. I whole-heartedly recommend this movie!"
5,As much fun watching a movie that you can,"Kung Fu Hustle is one of those films you might easily pass up. But I rented it one day and was incredibly surprised. The story isn't the main point even though it is a good one. But the characters are the big kicker. All the fights are great to watch. Now trying to get the wife to watch it is a different story. But if she is cool or you just want great fun in a movie, I would even buy it without even seeing it first. Especially at the low cost."
3,Kung Fu Hustle,"This is a GREAT movie, however it is subtitled. There is no mention of subtitles on the rental site. There is an English language version. I assumed that was the one I was renting (shame on me). As I said, there is no mention of subtitles on the rental site (shame on Amazon). LET THE VIEWER BEWARE."
5,A Great Comedy!,Kung Fu Hustle is a great comedy! The movie has a great story and tons of laughs. I was laughing through out the whole movie non stop. It is a great movie for the whole family all though there is a lot of strong violence. That is all I have to say.
3,Not as much as I expected but I like it.,"The fit was true I ordered my size hoping it didn't run small. The length was shorter than expected. The robe in the picture I expected but after review I guess it doesnt say it is but, it doesn't say it is not included. For the price I expected it to include robe."
2,Paid too Much,I purchased this to replace a broken Pocket Handyman IV. I was disappointed in the metric to inch features of the new Construction Master Pro. I work with inch to millimeters conversion. The new calculator only has keys to go between inches and meters. The cost of the Construction Master Pro was too much for my use.
3,Good preformance but once again poor sound.,"I've been a fan of and going to Rush concerts since Hemispheres. Saw them 5 times on the S&A; tour alone. They are wonderful musicians and performers. The live concerts rock. And this DVD is a great show but....Why oh why can't musicians of this quality get their act together and produce / engineer a consistent quality sounding product. Rush just seems to have more audio engineering issues than they should, (either lame washed out and tinny with no low end or over amped and distorted to the max), and this DVD is no different. As others have mentioned it lacks low end. Big time. Geddy's bass seems to be almost non existent sometimes. Neil's low end toms and kick bass drums have no oomph or punch at all. R-30's sound quality is better than this....Rio worse.Too bad cause the show is great. Hopefully they do at least one more tour and live shot and produce it with a quality audio engineer."
3,More of the same,"I love Rush, but I'm a little bummed I bought this. I already have the Rush in Rio and R30 concerts dvds. They are a couple of my all time favorites. This just didn't add much to the mix. Don't get me wrong, if you don't have a Rush concert dvd, this is a great one to grab (although I still love the passion and performance and song list of Rush in Rio). Sound quality is terrific. I just expected something a little more special given the reviews on this site."
5,Great concert!,"Here is another great concert from, in my opinion, one of the most talented bands around. If you haven't seen them before, this is a great dvd. As good as it is though, I would say the R30 dvd is the one to get to get a feel for their whole catalog of music. I went to this tour and was a little let down by their playing too much off of the new album. (Which some bands are doing these days). But it's Rush, and I HAD to see them because they might not come around again...you never know!"
5,RUSH is THE best music group literally ever to exist!!,"You will love this Snakes and Arrows DVD for many reasons. As a drummer, one of the best things about it should be Neil Peart's Rotterdam Netherlands drum solo! When I saw Neil play his drum solo in Virginia in July of 2008, it was the best drum solo I've ever seen in my entire life! Well I guess maybe tied with Buddy Rich because I saw him once but that's jazz and he's Buddy Rich - long story. You know, Rush will not disappoint if you get this DVD - they never have. They are hard workers, humanitarians, seem like super nice musicians and in my opinion RUSH is the best rock music band in the universe, but I'm biased! I've been Neil's biggest fan since I was 10 years old! We love you very much Neil, Ged and Alex!"
5,Simply Amazing,"I typically shy away from aging musicians... as they usually disappoint in comparison to their heyday. After attending two ""Snakes and Arrows"" dates in Atlanta however, RUSH totally proved me wrong. This Blueray does nothing short of capturing RUSH at the top of their game. In fact, I challenge you to find any concert DVD (or Blueray) of any other act that beats this one in picture, sound, editing, and general camera work. If you haven't checked out the newest RUSH album, you may want to purchase that as well. Excellent peice of work!"
4,awesome!!!,"I loved the last book in the series! It was so great! I totally fell in love with the characters and i was really waiting for Anothony and Rae to hook up! I could't put the book down once i started reading it. The series also took place where i live, Atlanta, Ga! i often go to Little Five Points so that was a big bonus! I would sit in my room and read it till 3 o'clock in the morning telling myself just one more chapter but i couldnt stop! The only thing that bothered me was the series ended leaving me so puzzled! I keep wondering, did Mandy and Jessie hook up? When does Sam die? Did Anthony and Rae ever marry? Are the gaurds that saw Yana and Sam escape come after them again!? She needs to make another book for me to be fully satisfied! But other than the ending, i totally LOVED the book! Fingerprints is my new favorite book series!"
4,Vabagond Tales,Bought as a gift for my son who is enjoying it immensely. Although used it was in excellent condition and came within a few days.
4,I liked it...,"Really like the desk--good size to work with--the only negative is it chips easily--already has a small area where the paint chipped off the door. Overall, a good deal for the money"
3,its alright,"they came in two big boxes and they're really heavy. It took me about two hours to assemble it with my boyfriend, but it's really pretty so it's alright. However the thing is that when I assembled it the top part of the desk cracked and now there's a thin line on the desk, but I don't want my two hours of work go to waste and lazy to send it for a return so I'm just keeping this."
1,Really really bad film - don't even think about it,"Although the film was beyond brutal filled with mindless nothing, some of the acting was good and believable. Too bad they had the worst script in the world to work with. Nothing else to say, move on folks nothing to see here."
5,Our nephew love it,"We bought our nephew this bag for his birthday. His 17"" dell fits great in it. He even puts his school books in it sometimes."
4,Very interesting and filled with suspense,"Read the book, it was great, saw the movie and it was good, but nothing compared to the book.... In the book, Terrorists seize Air Force One with the president, the first lady, their thirteen-year-old daughter, and more than fifty staff members.The terrorists threaten to execute a hostage every thirty minutes if their demands are not met. Washington has a NO HOSTAGE policy and they refuse to give in to the terrorists demands. The suspense escalates from there... The president is left to protect his family with the help of some of his staff.This is great reading material. I read it while on a nine hour flight, so that made it more intense..."
5,One great book,I'm 11 years and this was one of the best books I read. I know this because when ever I had the time I was stuck in that book. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes suspense and a good book
4,a lesson about true friendship,one day a half mermaid girl finds a hidden cave filled with gold and strange symbols. this cave holds a sea monster called the kraken. the girl emily then looses her best friemd shoma. shona is a real mermaid who is fit for a friemd. but after emily drags shona into the cave shona seems to lay off emily. will emily be abke to renew her friendship and calm the kraken before shona forgets about her and the island allpoints islamd emily liveds on is crushed by the krakem? find out im this adventuew thriller!
2,Not all thats its cracked up to be...,"My son is 19 months old now. I really dislike this highchair. Our nanny, who cleans it, dislikes it even more.I HAD to have this chair..just like I HAD to have a 4 different kinds of strollers (Peg-Martinelli, Bugaboo, Mclaren and a Jogger), 50 baby blankets, a kelty, a bjorn, Mustella (only), ...I could go on...for days..My mom laughs that I slept in a drawer and she used regular soap on my bald head. She still laughs at my baby wipe warmer that almost caught on fire.Anyway, my words of wisdom of my 19 months of momdom, save your money for a nice dinner...get a $30 booster seat. When having company, booster fits nicely in the closet and cleans up in a second.Oh, and forget cleaning the straps...ick!"
2,Surfline video review,I would not recommend renting or buying this video as the first film on the Surfline is out of focus for some reason. At one point I had a DVD of this film and the focus was fine. There is no problem with the focus on the second segment of this video on the California Western Railroad.
3,"Great Item, but not the same as photo",I like this foot muff purely because of its functionallity. It keeps my little one nice and toasty when it's cold.What I don't like is that the footmuff pictured is not the one I received. The pictured footmuff is red with a pattern on the inside. The one I got was more of an orangy red color with just a beige inside with no pattern. My husband describes the footmuff as a lobster fisherman color.I love all Stokke products so the only reason this did not get 5 stars is because I got the wrong footmuff.
1,Piece of Garbage,"1st trip out, one wheel fell off after the other. Apparently, empty the cart is great, however when carrying groceries (i.e. a mile and a half away from home), the cotter pins fall out and the wheels come off.It would be one thing if this were a cheap model, but at $65, it's $65 more than it's worth.Stay away."
5,Scarling is the thing that is missing in your life,"Ever felt incomplete? Confused? Violated by trashy songs that don't exactly complete you? Want something to relate with, something that you know from the second you bought it that it was destined to be? Obviously this cd is the answer to your prayers. I bought every single one of their cds the second I heard the music from So Long Scarecrow. It's spreading like an OCD music disease, but at the same time is welcomed by our age.I'd recommend it more than any other cd I own. (and that's saying something).-Wes (Provo, Utah)"
5,"SO LONG, SCARECROW.","So Long, Scarecrow is a work of art. It's one of the best and most addiciting albums I've ever owned. With each listen the songs get better and better. Scarling. has taken huge steps forward since Sweet Heart Dealer and I believe they have really found their true and unique sound. So Long, Scarecrow is full of emotion, distorition, and beautiful vocals from the truly amazing Jessicka. This 13 song album has a bit of everything. I found the songs truly catchy, original, and full of depth nobody but Scarling. could pull off. I think this album not only shows how much Scarling. has grown but how amazing they're going to be in the future. I would recommend this album to anyone, this is a must have for any Scarling. or JOJ fans.What are you waiting for? GO BUY IT! :P"
3,eh - not the best,"It's not right to compare Jack Off Jill and Scarling, because the bands are basically polar opposites. My musical tastes lends itself more (much more) toward Jack Off Jill, and this CD is just lacking a little something. The songs seem to blend into each other and proves to be a little monotonous. I listened to the full CD about a dozen times before the songs started to become a little catchy, which isn't a good signal that I'm in love with it. I think their previous efforts (earlier Scarling Cd's) were much more compelling and diverse."
5,Fantastic,"I think this album was great, yes it was a huge step away from Jack Off Jill. Want to know why? Because it's Scarling, not Jack Off Jill. The bands only share a common thing which is Jessicka. People should not expect to different bands with different genres to sound alike. I personally adore Scarling, and can't wait for other albums they decide to throw at us. So long, scarecrow, touches on many subjects including narcissism and indulgence in everything. Even songs of changes. I think it should appeal to most people, and be enjoyed."
5,Women in Black,"With this book blurbed by Franzen and Foster Wallace you know sort of what you're in for: verbal brilliance, unusual settings, darker humor. Costello does not disappoint. His novel about Vi, a Secret Service agent assigned to an unnamed Vice President in the midst of a Presidential campaign, also tells of Vi's larger family, her collegues, their 'down time' lives, and a refracted view of America. While Costello seems to fit right into a certain subcategory of novelists (afore mentioned Franzen and Wallace--what category would that be labelled I wonder?) he isn't a clone. He has a more narrative driven, accessible novel here, one where you get to care about some of the characters; certainly he is very very talented with the language; quick wit."
3,Waiting for action.,"Beautifully written book that goes nowhere fast. If it hadn't been so seamlessly written, I'd never have wasted several hours of my life on it. He could have done better with a little effort, too bad."
2,Disappointing,"I picked up this book thinking I was going to get great inside dope on the secret service and a compelling plot. While Costello certainly includes some great nuggets here and there, overall he's more concerned about trivial, everyday occurances that don't advance the story. By the end of the book, I was left with a big ""is that it?"" feeling. Skip it or borrow it."
4,Recommended novel about the Secret Service,"Costello's survey of a Secret Service security detail guarding an unnamed Al Gore character in the 2000 NH primary has a long lead-up but provides engaging writing about characters as we learn about the people involved in the final scene. (One of the reviewers below writes that nothing happens -- I wonder if they finished the book.) I agree that the book isn't a conventional novel -- see it instead as an Event with the main protagonists drawn in illuminating detail. For example, the description of Tashmo is terrific -- his admiration for Reagan, his aspirations to look like a semi-Cowboy dude, his persistent womanizing, the whole routine about fixing his truck while he is up in NH guarding the VP. Very entertaining and readable.After reading ""The Big If"", I asked a friend who's brother was in te Secret Service whether the job was a tense one. He said that it wasn't - rather, it was boring with occasional flare-ups."
1,couldn't get past the first 30 or so pages,"I love well-written books and read hundreds each year, but this one left me cold. I put it back in the 'return-to-library' pile as soon as the protagonist tossed a live parakeet in it's cage out a car window. UGH. I do admit that up until then I was struggling anyway so it really did not take much to convince me to give up. I just didn't get anything amusing, inciteful or profound out of those initial, awkward pages."
4,The power of a lonesome voice.....,"That tatterd guitar and the years of heart-breaking living come to the surface on this album. You hear strains of ""Me & Paul"" on the title track and the the others bring you back to 'Blue Eyes' and 'Bloody Mary Morning'---the golden years! This is a great album."
5,Great Book for the money!,The book was in excellent condition. It arrived on time for a Christmas gift. The receiver was thrilled as it has historical pictures and a historical accounting of the incident.
5,Little Scarlet,This is one of my favorite authors. I really enjoyed reading this novel and can't wait until the next one comes out.Excellent book!
2,Not Sturdy,"We bought this case for an 80 GB Ipod Classic. It was a tight fit, but that was not a problem. The openings are in the right place, and we had no plans to take it out of the case often. However, the hinge is very weak. After being used only a few weeks, it started popping open at the slightest touch. It will not stay closed now. We decided to switch to a different case."
5,Great Product,"Bare Minerals makes great products that when used according to their instructions gives lasting performance. I'm sad they are discontinuing this color, it makes the perfect base eyeshadow."
3,fun,"love the color. can't use BE every day on my eyes or they swell up. I do love the color, though."
2,Bit choppy...not the usual Medwed read,"I've read Ms Medwed's other novels, however this one just didn't read as well (as the others). I honestly couldn't get past the first chapter. The writing seemed all over the place. Can't say I liked the main character either. I also couldn't get past the names of her kids....Timmy and Johnny. Ugh."
2,Needed more information,"The book was detailed on jobs, but could have used information on salaries. It was also very basic not too much detail involved in this one."
5,"Subtle pedal, nicely built, easy to operate","This little pedal is really nice if you are looking for a subtle way to help your sound. I play bass, and I use this pedal now all the time, although I may use it for select songs as I learn more about it. If you are looking for a radical makeover in your tone, this is not the pedal for you. If you are looking for the finishing touches to an already nice tone, this is worth looking at. The Amazon price is almost half what it costs on other sites, and if you have Amazon Prime, return shipping is free, so you have nothing to lose by trying it out!"
4,LIFE EXPERIENCES,"GREAT BOOK, I THINK IT WOULD MAKE A GREAT MOVIE.ESPECIALLY FOR THE ONES THAT DO CIVAL WAR ENACTMENTS!"
3,Caribbean adventure,"In the mid-1980s, Janet travels to one of the islands in the Turks & Caicos group to do research on the island's history. She befriends Michelle, an unhappy married woman, and the two are more and more drawn to each other. When Janet stumbles on Michelle's brother's dead body, she finds herself drawn into a convoluted mystery of hidden agendas, political corruption, and blackmail. She continues her research and finds some rather intriguing information about one of the famous denizens (which reminded me of Patricia Powell's ""The Pagoda""). Like the other reviewers, I found the book fascinating, as well as sensual and compelling. The love affair doesn't end happily, rather hopeful."
2,A very poor serial,"First there is the problem of the VCI logo flashing every four minutes for twenty seconds. It is completely unacceptable to interfere with potential enjoyment of a product in that fashion.That said, it is hard to enjoy this serial. Virtually the entire serial is a repeat of a basic car chase and the use of some ridiculous gadget at headquarters to resolve the cliffhanger.Captain Video is frozen on a distant planet and headquarters just happens to locate him and send out a defroster beam. Pure cheese.This serial is for completist collectors only. Others should look elsewhere"
3,Stepfather Villain Part XII,"I feel sorry for stepparents. It seems that they are used way too often in films as the villains. This is another one of those.A 12-year-old boy's divorced mother (Teri Polo) remarries the owner of the town's brickworks (Vince Vaughn, once again playing the ""Psycho""). The town thinks he is the greatest (as we are told in far-from-subtle scenes, including one presentation of an award from the Chamber of Commerce), so when the boy sees him kill someone, no one believes him except his poor boatbuilder father (John Travolta, once again playing the noble character--we know this because his first scene involves his selling of a boat below cost, the filmmakers make sure to spell out everything for us). The main reason for his not being believed however is that he lies (which we are told in no uncertain terms at least twice.Despite this being not the most intelligent film, I was able to enjoy myself. It has tension in all the right places and good acting all around."
3,Less than mediocre story...,"Frank (John Travolta) is concerned about his son Danny who is often getting into trouble. It seems like it stems from his ex-wife remarrying with Rick Barnes (Vince Vaughn). Frank's ex-wife also wants him to try to help Danny become more accepting of Rick. Frank finds it hard, but understands the dilemma and does what he thinks is best for Danny. Frank even attends his ex-wife's wedding in order to make Danny feel more comfortable with the situation. At the wedding, Frank meets Ray Coleman (Steve Buscemi) whom shows up unexpectedly and it seems to make Rick feel surprised and uncomfortable. It seems like Rick has a dark past together with Ray and it is about to cross Danny's future. Domestic Disturbance is a thriller that has a terrific cast, but they do not save the less than mediocre story."
4,Enjoyable Thriller,"Definately an enjoyable, fast-paced thriller that would have been nothing if not for the performance involved. A second viewing helps, w/ a few throwaway hints (Steve Buscemi agressively calling Vince Vaughn ""Jack!"" and Vince Vaughn telling Teri Polo what stress might do to her) that tighten the plot. One thing, however: Why didn't the DVD include the alternate ending that ended up being re-shot? From what I understand there's about 20 minutes of different material that could have resulted in a very nice, ""Joy Ride""-type disc."
3,Worth Renting For A Couple Of Bucks,"This was a decent thriller with good-guy ""Frank Morrison"" (John Travolta) trying to save his former family from the dangerous new husband. That's not a new theme in Hollywood movies (the dangerous husband) but this is acted well and presented without heavy-handedness. They were smart to keep the story relatively-short, too, at 89 minutes. As a consequence, nothing dragged.To me, the film would have been more enjoyable had the 12-year-old boy been a nicer kid, but he's an annoying brat. The mother (Teri Polo) is not that endearing, either. Definitely a movie that will entertain but a one-look film and nothing more, especially with the ending being as predictable as it turned out."
2,A by the numbers thriller that's way to short,Domestic Disturbance is strictly a by the numbers thriller. Director Harold Becker who made the superior Sea Of Love seems to walk through this film. John Travolta does give a good performance though and Vince Vaughn does ok as the bad guy but I wish he would have been more meancing. After seeing Vaughn in comedy's of late he's pigeonholed in my mind as a comedic actor not a hard a$$.
3,Swing arm mirror,I'm satisfied with this mirror. We placed it on the wall beside the BR sink so my wife can use the magnifying side for make-up and she can take care of the back of her hair as well. The only weak point I've seen is the lack of locking washers on the sides of the mirror.
5,preposterous but great,"The publisher must not have advertised this book AT ALL -- I found it purely by accident -- but it is a wonderful first mystery in the ""screwball"" mode. In fact, I read a great many of these, and this is one of the best -- entertaining without being too strained. As other reviewers have noted, the plot involves writer Cece Caruso, writing a biography of Erle Stanley Gardner and suffering writer's block. Reading old correspondence leads her to a convicted murderer who asked for Gardner's help decades ago and who is still in jail. Cece decides to solve the crime.Following this plot obviously involves considerable suspension of disbelief, but the story moves along at a good clip with entertaining episodes and all the right ingredients -- an old mystery, a locked box, wacky best friend, and so forth. I highly recommend it."
1,Painful,"I got an Ipod for Xmas and wanted something to allow me to charge/play, in one unit. I saw this at a local store. The look and price were compelling. I got it home, set it up. There were a couple of negatives, right off the bat. First, like many others have mentioned, there was a constant light buzz or hiss sound. Some songs were better at hiding the sound, but some were painful. The other big issue I had with this was the button which allows you to change between the FM and ""Ipod"" mode. When I pressed the button to go into ""Ipod"" mode and played a track, initially only one of the speakers worked, then eventually, the other kicked in.I am realistic. I am not expecting a Bose sound out of this, but come on. Right out of the box and both speakers iratically work. Nice.I took it back. You get what you pay for."
1,looks great but sounds terribe,Same comment as other reviewers -- low grade hissing constantly. This is my second one and i'm taking it back.
5,Very Good Whistle,"I like this whistle's slim design. I wear it when shopping in rough areas. If I am apprehended, I intend to use the whistle to draw attention to me and the assailant. This whistle is much louder than my voice, and carries well across other sounds."
1,Received wrong item,"Ordered this item, which is a clear folding stand, and got a small black stand instead: http://www.amazon.com/BCW-Pro-Mold-Sports-Stand-Display/dp/B000MWM05O/ref=pd_bxgy_sg_img_cWas a part of a Christmas present so I had to deal with it. I do not appreciate paying $4.28 for an item and getting an entirely different item worth under a dollar. I feel ripped off, be prepared to deal with a mix-up like this in case it happens again."
3,Surprise elephant review,"The product seemed small for its price. Our one year old grandson had played with the toy at a friend's house and enjoyed it. We ordered it for him because our daughter told us that he seemed to like playing with it at his friend's house. It was not packaged very well. It will be loved by our grandson, so that makes its a wothwhile purchase."
5,Great stuff!,"""Todo de mi"" is by far one of the best productions of the year. A very complete CD, with music wisely chosen and Janina's voice is better than ever. It has so much variety of music but always staying in her line and that's what makes this CD an unique product. Buy it, you won't regret it."
1,p,"This drive worked beutifully in the first 6 months in on of our school research laboratories, regardless of the infrequent unexplained miscommunication with the PC. After they trusted it for work and research data backup, done just once every 2 weeks, it suddenly gave clicking sounds and stopped working. After extended agony with the customer support, they simply got nothing. Surperisingly, when they talked about this subject with some of our collegues in our University, they discovered that many of us, in defferent departments, suffered from the same problem with different models of the Wistern Digital external hard drives (USB/Firewire).After all the frustration and the torture with this piece of junk, I can say for sure, Buy WD if you are looking for the best machine to lose your data? Beleive me when I say Western Digital Hard Drives are absolutely the worst for your data storage. We've been there before."
4,good book,"this is a wonderful book. it is just of photos though, so it will not teach you yoga. wonderful tool for any yoga teacher or anyone who loves to see all the different poses out there.the reason i didn't give this a 5 star review is that the binding on my book came off completely and all the pages are starting to fall out. will have to take to staples or some place like that to see if they can fix it. they squeezed too many pages into such a tiny book.other than that it's a great book, well worth the money!"
5,Asanas,I bought this small book when I volunteered at kripalu.It is very simple. Pictures of 608 asanas of the 900 poses that exist. My method in using it is to hold it in my hand while doing my flow. It works well for me.
1,Never arrived,"I never got the books due to a confusion. The book ""Power Yoga for Dummies"" I never ordered.I want the other 2 books though: Asanas and Light on Yoga.There are confusions all the time and I do not want to be overcharged due to Amazon's confusion.Thank you"
2,Asanas 608 Yoga Poses,"This is a book that has one asana on each page. It's a little thick book. If you practice yoga, you will find many poses you have never seen or done. Each pose has the sanskrit name and the english, but does not include anything else such as how to get into the pose. It is interesting by I don't use it in yoga. If you want a challenge, this might be your book."
5,A jewel,"This little book is beautiful as well as powerful. It is not an instruction book for beginners, but will certainly provide inspiration to anyone on the yoga path, no matter what their level of experience. For more experienced practitioners who seek to elevate their practice or add variety, this book is a gift. The photographs of Sri Mittra clearly show the pose from the best angle to see the necessary detail. Most of the photos were taken when Mittra was 45, but a few shots of a much older Mittra are a shining testament to the rejuvenating effects of a dedicated practice. Each photo illustrates Mittra's grace and strength and hints at a more spiritual aspect of the practice. Any serious student of yoga will consider this book a treasure."
