1,mens ultrasheer,"This model may be ok for sedentary types, but I'm active and get around alot in my job - consistently found these stockings rolled up down by my ankles! Not Good!! Solution: go with the standard compression stocking, 20-30, stock #114622. Excellent support, stays up and gives me what I need. Both pair of these also tore as I struggled to pull them up all the time. Good riddance/bad investment!"
4,Surprisingly delightful,"This is a fast read filled with unexpected humour and profound insights into the art of politics and policy. In brief, it is sly, wry, and wise."
2,"Works, but not as advertised","I bought one of these chargers..the instructions say the lights stay on while the battery charges...true. The instructions doNT say the lights turn off when its done. Which is also true. 24 hours of charging and the lights stay on. I returned it thinking I had a bad unit.The new one did the same thing. I just kept it since it does charge...but the lights are useless since they seem to always stay on. It's a ""backup"" charger for when I manage to drain all my AAs but I wouldn't want this as my only charger."
2,Oh dear,"I was excited to find a book ostensibly about Muslim feminism, but this volume did not live up to the expectations.One essay, among other things, describes the veil as potentially liberating. It doesn't begin to explain how or why.Another, on Muslim women in Cape Town, claims that Muslim women there are separate but ""more than equal."" Gee whiz, what a disappointment.I had expected and hoped for at least one Muslim feminist condemnation of gender apartheid. But there is not a single one in the book.I'm surprised it didn't have an essay extolling the virtues of female genital mutilation.--Alyssa A. Lappen"
2,Incorrect disc!,"I am a big JVC fan, but I do not like this model, I was suspiscious when I saw several units in the return section of the store. I bought one anyway (new) and must say I am not happy. The unit sends out clicks to the receiver once in a while, the transition between scenes is not always smooth,(like a little pause) and while it is still fairly new I can't get any DVD,CD or even a DVD headcleaner to work. All I get is a ""incorrect disc"" message."
2,Incorrect Disc,"I love the style of this, but after a couple years, the DVD is giving me problems. It doesn't even work anymore and I use my broken PS2 Now. I wouldn't recommend this, I'm just going to upgrade to a recorder now. I wish it would work but I guess i'm giving up on JVC. I really did like this one... before it stopped working. The dvd player gave me problems probably after a year of having it."
2,DVD menu select problems,"I cannot scroll through a DVD menu that is set up vertically. The triangle keys will only select horizontally. So I cannot select anything on most DVD's besides play. No special features, no language select, nothing, just play."
3,My 2 y/o grandson loves it!!,"This movie with all of its animals really keeps my grandson occupied when I'm babysitting. He loves watching it over and over again. I can get so much accomplished before he gets bored with it. So, it is worth the money! As a matter of fact, I'm buying one for his house, his 3 y/o cousins' and my house. We're saying goodbye to Netflix! Way to go Amazon!!Gammy"
5,A Cookbook Every Baker Should Own,"I found a copy of this cookbook at a local used book store and mixed up a sourdough starter the following day. It was bubbling away the next morning and I can't wait to try it in a few more days...The directions in this book are simple to follow. The anecdotes and history provided are entertaining. The recipes all sound delicious! I'll be working my way through many of these, starting of course with the sourdough hotcakes and bread. The handwritten format just adds to the charm of the book. If you're interested in learning to make sourdoughs, this book will give you all the information you'll need."
3,good basic,"The book is a basic ""how to"" book for using sourdough. The author obviously has lots of experience cooking with a sourdough starter.I would have loved more recipes, but I did go search for my more on the internet."
3,nice screen for a nice price but....,"I compared a few different flat panels with review before I narrowed down my pick, which ended up with the Sylvania as over well liked. The picture got great reviews which yes it does have a good picture to look at but there are other important qualities you enjoy that makes viewing tv all the better. For example: sound... how was that forgotten?In this flat panel, it was. What a disappointment. If this is consider stereo than why does it sound like its coming from a tin can with no base at all. Then too boot, if you play the dvd, the sound drops and you have to really turn up the volume to hear.I want the whole package deal: space saving, great picture, and good sound. I want to enjoy the whole experience of watching and listening. How about you?"
3,"Poor maps, no hostels","It's a good book, but the maps are not very good, covering only parts of central areas and there aren't subway maps. Moreover there isn't anything about hostels!"
2,Profound then. Truly horrible now.,"The narrative style of this work by famous founders' biographer John Morse is arrogant, flippant and frequently exaggerated. It carries the tone of the amateur Yankee historian on high, passing judgment on this Southern statesman who was neither from Boston nor a Harvard graduate. Perhaps considered penetrating for its day, it really represents nothing more than opinion today. The research is so thin that one must conclude that Morse wrote the entire manuscript essentially from memory, with little reference to the primary and secondary sources we expect of historians now. If it weren't for the fact that Morse wrote this piece 110 years ago, I'd have rated it only one star."
1,A complete Bust,"This game requires quicktime 5.0 to work...if you have a better version of quicktime (I have 7.5), it will ask you to install the quicktime available on the CD...if you click no, it will not let you play. So, I begrudgingly clicked yes on the third try, and it installed quicktime 5, THEN it tells me to please install the quicktime available on the disc. It KEPT telling me that, even after I uninstalled my version of quicktime 7.5, and reinstalled Barbie Rapunzel and quicktime 5. Very frustrating, and the game absolutely will not work for me. It keeps telling me over and over, to install quicktime 5, tho I've been through the installation process repeatedly. It is NOT my ""operating system limitations"". This is a brand new computer...merely weeks old with all the state of the art contraptions."
5,Barbie as Rapunzel: A Creative Adventure,"I purchased this software for my 5 year old granddaughter and she loves playing it so much. She lets me play it sometimes, but she doesn't always like what I come up with. I plan to purchase other software programs for her."
5,Best Game for Young Girls,"My daughter absolutely loves this game! It's easy to use and requires no adult supervision. Best of all, it allows girls to use their creativity to design their own castle one room at a time. What more could a girl want! My daughter wants to play it every day and I have to find excuses to keep her away! Too bad not all the Barbie games are this easy and fun. I've been very disappointed in others I purchased. I discovered that they're not all designed/published by the same company. I paid 5.99 for this game on clearance and it's been worth 10 times this amount!"
2,Not so good - ok for a rental!,"This game is pretty exciting and it is very nice and it is really creative and one of a kind. The only bad thing is that there is only one ""castle"" for the kids to ""decorate"" and once you are done with the whole castle that is basically it. You either have to create a new username for yourself to do it all over again or you get another game like I did. My sister finished the ""castle"" in about 2 hours and after that has never even looked at this game anymore. It is a nice game and it is fun but it is not really worth that much money."
1,NOT OS X but MAC CLASSIC,"NEGATIVE: This game does not work with OS X and requires the CD so you can't have it on multiple computers. It is slow I have to tell my daughter that it is thinking a lot, this is because it has to access the CD everytime there is a new task. You can't view the openning sequence again without throwing out the saved game files. Some of the tasks and controls are too hard and not user friendly even for adults.it CRASHES all the time.Mouse is jumpy and hard to use.POSITIVE: Some tasks are easy, possible to use, grand and beautiful.My three year has enough patience to survive the multiple trials to get this to work."
4,"Good Program, Lots of Flexibility",My 4year old really likes this game. She's not addicted to it but loves the style of the program and it is one of her favourite games. I recommend this program for 4-7 year olds. Anybody older may find it limited.
3,A Blast From My Past,"I once purchased a 12"" of Jesse Rae's song RUSHA. I really enjoyed it and thought it might be nice to have an overview of his work. It's funny how you can remember somthing fondly only to hear it later in life and think...it's okay. Sorry, but the same is true for this recording, a bit dated, a bit tiresome, but fun."
1,Very disappointed!,This perfume is just AWFUL! Smells nothing like freesia.The gift recipient was not impressed. The worst is that it can't be returned!
5,Filled from cover to cover with practical guidance,"Written by Elizabeth Crary (a parent educator of 25 years' experience), Dealing With Disappointment: Helping Kids Cope When Things Don't Go Their Way offers parents, teachers, child care providers, and anyone else who works with children a straightforward guidance to teaching children how to meet and deal with seemingly insurmountable challenges. From learning to recognize when children are truly upset or shaken; to the dangers of trying to make or keep children happy at all times; to teaching young ones self-calming and problem-solving skills with step-by-step guides and games; to learning how to keep one's cool when the kids lose theirs, Dealing With Disappointment is an excellent and strongly recommended resource filled from cover to cover with positive and practical guidance and guidelines."
5,Hardest Pit in the South,"Big Pokey is one of the best rappers out of the South. No one can do it like him. This album is a small example of what he can do on the mic. Need more proof, listen to the old Screw tapes. You must have this cd in your collection and be on the look out for that new Big Pokey coming soon!!!"
5,Amazin,"This is an amazing blend of hot beats and a good rapper. It's underground, so many of you might be nervous about buying it. But, I'll tell you, Pokey sounds a lot like Biggie Smalls (BIG). He has biggie's style, usin words like sho nuff. Pokey's lyrics are good, but a few lyrics could use a little work. A few of his songs have complex beats, but most have a little bit of a more simple beat. The album comes together great. Get it! Trust me...its worth the money"
1,Caution!,"These tracks are not the ""original"" versions but are re-recorded versions. So, whether the tracks are ""remastered"" or not is irrelevant."
2,Not the best in the series,"Tess Lindsay is content to be the sole occupant of a remote island but when Colin Macpherson washes ashore her life of solitude gets shaken up. Tess had always been told to fear strange men but she reluctantly strikes up a friendship with Colin. Soon Tess discovers that she has a family she had forgotten about but will she have the courage to leave the island and start a new life?The beginning of this book is very amusing and the end is decent too but the middle is a big problem. The plot loses much of it's believability mostly due to the poor characterization. All of the new characters that are introduced are one sided and their behavior lacks reason. Even Tess and Colin's development is side tracked in much the same way and their relationship seems awkward and forced. The writing does improve towards the end but it's not enough to save the book. Unless you have your heart set on reading all of the books in the series, skip this one."
2,Too Uncomfortable and Too Big,"These pants were way too big (looked about 2 sizes larger), and they were incredibly stiff. They would have been very uncomfortable for my daughter to wear all day."
5,DOPE SEZ ME,"THIS IS SIMPLY A GREAT ALBUM, FULLA CLASSIC BEATS AND SUPER FUTURISTIC INTELLIGENT BASS. ON OF MY FAVORITES."
4,Very authentic,"This is my first encounter with Yoruba and I have to say that CDs are really helping. However, the book is very short and not particular about certain aspects and details of grammar and other nuances - for someone who NEVER spoke Yoruba and doesn't have anybody to ask for a clue, it leaves a lot of questions unanswered - for this, however, there are hopefully other Yoruba textbooks.On the brighter note, I would like to add that the book does a very good job in giving a little insight on Yoruba people and Yoruba culture in general. I would recommend it as a good start book for anyone who wants to learn Yoruba - you can't go wrong with it."
4,good,works real good....a little hard to set up...web part doesnt work thru handset manager as advertised.....have to go into networking and turn it on
3,Too Big,It is a quality ball but the small is still too big and heavy for my little yorkie to play with comfortably.
3,A decent read,"I have to admit that this is a book I never would have thought to purchase given that it would mean reading the bio of an 18 year old kid!!! Still, it was a gift and I have to say that I was very surprised.The book is short (under 200 pgs) and is an easy read. However, I found that a lot of the book read like a magazine article, given that the author usually writes for Slam magazine, this is no surprise. Still, it is interesting and entertaining. I would recommend for fans of Lebron, high school ball, or die-hard hoops fans."
5,ME FASCINA LEER LA VIDA PROFESIONAL,"Y TAMBIEN LA VIDA INTIMA DE LOS TRIUNFADORES...Por eso me fascinÃ³ este libro que me regalÃ³ mi esposa !Y seguro a mis cuantes tambien..porque alguno de ellos me ""incautÃ³ "" el libro !YA DEVUELVELO, BRO!"
3,Oh's what a cereal! (^_^) ...Oh's what a price (O_o),"Man I love Oh's cereal. It is really great to the last bite, but the size of the box its so small compared to all the other cereals out there. The price is crazy for such a small box...but oh's is one of the best cereals I have ever ever eaten. It keeps me coming back despite the small box, and crazy price. If you never had it you should try it just once. It is wonderful I give it 3 stars only because of the price and how much food you get. If the portions were more fair even for this price it would be five star gold..."
5,Divinely Wonderful,In a world where media is dominant this movie is so refreshing as it chronicles the agony of a person who yearns for God. Watch it! 0:)
2,Never gets going,"This book never really seems to get going. There is too much time spent in the courtroom while basic questions about the crime and the suspect/defendant are left unasked.After 200 pages, I realized that this book wasn't going to pick up or reveal any crucial information to make sense out of things until the very end.As a result, the whole story rapped up very quickly in an unbelievable way and you are left wondering why no one could figure anything out earlier. Based on the ending, the detectives and attorneys appear rather incompetent.I did enjoy parts of the book, however, and I think the plot needs to be unfolded at a different rate (not so slow in the beginning and not so fast at the end). I am a McBain fan and think that some of his other books are better written."
4,Good Stuff,"This book is quite touching. It tells Dorie's story of all the unbelievably horribe things she experience while growing up being abused both physially and sexually. It gives hope to those who believe that no one's situation is as bad as their's or those who think recovery is not possible. If you are looking for self help to enhance you own healing journey this book is probably not what you need if you dont fall into the above categories. However, it is a great testimony to be aware of."
2,Yet another unsubstantiated case....,"While I believe in discrimination, I certainly can't believe what is in this book. It is an unsubstantiated smear campaign to rally the troups in higher ed to claw again for the preservation of academic freedom- a rally which falls flat."
2,Unmasked..................,"Sadly, there is absolutely nothing original in this movie. The filmmakers shamelessly borrowed from practically everyone, turning out a stale formula piece that is purely by the numbers. I couldn't find a thing that elevated this movie above a 100 other like films. The plot is standard: a group of kids spend the weekend at an old house with a bad history. A standard, run of the mill maniac kills them in unimaginative ways and of course no one notices until it's too late. Everything happens exactly on cue, in order, with no surprises, and no frights. This movie is safe and boring, it really couldn't have been any better if it tried. Not even the brief appearance of horror icon Michael Berryman (playing a nice guy for a change) can help the dullness of the script.Even the title is a misnomer! Although the original title, Maskerade, isn't any better.And I had such high hopes as this is one of my favorite genres."
4,A museum exhibit inside a book,"This book was in my library's Genealogy section, and you're not allowed to take Genealogy books out of the library. But I liked it enough to sit in the library and read it, in two sittings.This a quick read, because it has loads of pictures: photos of the ghetto and its inhabitants, and also pictures of artifacts such as ration cards, work certificates, yellow stars, etc. It's more like a museum exhibit than a simple book. Because of the format I think young people would be able to get something out of the book too, although it is clearly written for adults. Certainly it probably has the most information on the Kovno/Kaunas ghetto all in one place.Both researchers and the ordinary person interested in the Holocaust would enjoy this.Bonus: pages from the diary of Ilya Gerber are printed in this book; you can read extracts from the diary in Alexandra Zapruder'sSalvaged Pages: Young Writers' Diaries of the Holocaust."
4,Good introduction to Traditional Chinese Medicine,"As a physician who is studying and doing acupuncture, I find this a good basic introduction to Traditional Chinese Medicine. It is heavily illustrated, which helps the reader to understand some very difficult concepts, which are alien to the Western mind, especially for medical personnel. I can highly recommend it for someone who is interested in becoming familiar with Acupuncture and other Traditional Chinese Medicine."
5,Love it,"I bought this pillow for my mother, fiancee and myself. My mother loves it and sleeps much more comfortably with it. My fiance will not sleep with out it; according to him it gives him the best sleep he's ever gotten. I hurt my back a while back at work and this pillow has helped my back pains go away while giving me a restful night. I would definitely recommend this pillow."
2,Review of Artec Textureline Smoothing Serum,"I ordered this particular product as a trial substitute for the ""Controlgel"" by Textureline, which has always been my first choice. It appears that the ""Controlgel"" is out of production. This ""Smoothing Serum"" is a poor substitute. My barber agrees. He got me on the ""Controlgel"" years ago and I used to buy extra for him, but now, no more!! Too bad . . . we consumers lose again. I wish the ""Controlgel"" product would come back. My barber and I won't buy any more of the ""Smoothing Serum."" What a WASTE!!"
4,The best Racket ever made,I've been using this model racket for around 15 years and it's still one of the best rackets ever made by Prince. The Prince Graphite Mid Plus is still one of the stiffest rackets you can get and it also has excellence weight and balance.This racket is more suited to the higher standard player. It provides exceptional control especially with volleys. I have these rackets strung at between 62-64 pounds for hard court and grass court play.It will be a sad day when there are no more of these rackets available.
2,Bad skating technique,"I didn't buy this game, becuase I can tell by the pictures that Barbie has very bad skating technique (see below). This game is not for kids who want to have fun while seeing a good skating program.Pictures on Amazon1) Box picture -- I can't tell whether or not Barbie is stroking or doing a bad spiral? Either her leg is too high if she is stroking, or her body and leg are not in the right position if she is doing a spiral.2) Layback -- Although it's hard to see, it looks like Barbie might be spinning on her toe pick.3) Split jump -- Barbie does not have enough skating muscle for the jump. She is also not kicking her boots up.Pictures on vugames (makers of the game)1) Stroking -- Barbie's body is crooked. She doesn't have her weight over her stroking leg, and her body is leaning to the side. I've never seen anyone stroke like this."
3,Not for 8 year olds and up,This game interesting. It has good graphics and nice music. But if youre my age lets re-think the fun part. All you do is press up and down on the keybord and maybe you would hit the space bar. Well if your child likes challenging games well don't get this for them. THIS IS FOR A PRESCHOOLER!!!!
1,Waste of money!,"Like many of the Barbie CD Roms, the playtime is limited - averaging about 5 mins for each of my two daughters (ages 5 & 7). Like the Barbie movies and other CD Roms the graphics are poorly done."
4,A good game to buy.,"I bought this game for my daughter who is almost seven. She enjoys it very much. It works perfectly with Windows XP. I like the fact that it has skill levels, which helps avoid the ""frustration factor"", which I'm sure most of you reading this have experienced. The only reason that I did not give it a ""5"" is because it is quick to complete, especially on the ""easy"" and ""medium"" levels. Unless your child is totally into figure skating or Barbie, I feel this game is not for the 8+ crowd."
1,Three Days of Use and It Broke,"Very disappointed in this product. It worked perfectly for exactly three days and could not be resuscitated. It was very inexpensive so I did not want to pay half again the price to ship it back for an exchange, so the company would do nothing when they sent me an inquiry as to product satisfaction."
3,"It works, but it isn't great","These work fine and we now have two in the apartment, but i often have to take the remote off the wall and bring it closer to the switch to get the lights to turn off. It's not the greatest product and to be honest the as seen on TV handy switch works much better and is much cheaper."
5,One of my Favorites,"I was sceptical about this book at first, I had never read L. J. Smith before, but my friend told me to read it and let me borrow her's. It was soo good. That was about a year ago. I have now read up to Black Dawn in the Night World series, and can't wait for more. I recomended these books to my other friends and they loved them too. I recomend ANY L. J. Smith books to anyone."
5,You gotta read this book!,"I loved reading this book, it was so awesome. All of Lisa Jane Smith's books are. I was first drawn to this book because it involved three awesome sisters and they were all vampires. Plus I loved their older brother Ash! You have to read this book."
5,Great single,"I agree w/ the other fans: Chocolate is a fantastic single. If you like the song, you'll love the remixes! They give nice alternatives to an already gr8 song, and you'll get a bonus, non-album track. Highly recommended, and have a gr8 day, reader."
3,"It's just OK, not great",I bought the DVD thinking it would be back to back episodes of Thomas with no interruptions. Instead it has footage of a Thomas event and children and adults giving reviews of Thomas and their favorite episodes. I found it cheesy and annoying. My son loves Thomas and I hoped it would be strictly the episodes and not other footage. Thankfully the footage between the episodes is brief enough to tolerate the video.
5,Great Lessons!,Our two-year old grandson loved this - and we enjoyed watching it with him. Some good lessons to be learned by any age!
4,Nice mix of Thomas episodes and real footage.,My son really liked this as it shows some scenes from Thomas' Day Out which he could relate to having been before.The footage is mixed in with Thomas episodes and interviews. The brief interview sections did'nt really hold his attention but the rest is really good.
5,It is a surge protector,"What can I say it is a surge protector and small enough to use with small electronic items such as a wireless phone system, isolated devices and so on that do not need a big strip."
2,Too Small,"I have bought dockers for years but these are cut smaller than they usually are. Even with the ""stretch"" waist band they are tight. So much for an ""extra"" inch. Beware. Try these in a store before you buy."
2,Cut smaller than usual,"I agree, these are cut small... Buy an inch or two larger than you normally do. The waist band does NOT stretch."
3,Dockers Pants from Bealls,"I ordered the individual fit Dockers pants. Although there was a tag on the pants that said they were individual fit, thy lacked the inside label I am used to seeing stating they were individual fit. The fit seems a little different from other individual fit pants I have purchased. I think next time I will go back to a local retailer."
5,Fun Novel for Foodies,This novel is just fun...not super serious literature but enjoyable.I would recommend this to anyone who loves Italy and food...You can read it in a day....
4,The title says it all...,"This is a very fun book and if you love Rome, Romans, Romance and Food and Wine, you'll be ecstatic over this read! Enjoy and Bueno Appetito..."
2,Not very good....,"I bought this book to read as I myself ventured the streets of Italy...and to my dismay, the book was horrible. I searched everywhere for the book here in the states, and it was sold out everywhere...and to be honest, I am not sure why! All of the characters were not very well depicted, except for Laura. The description of Rome and the other cities the book took place in where not vivid. And the plot very predictible. The addition of the mafia in the story could have also been completely taken out...there was no need for it in the book! I just can't seem to think of anything really good to say about this book...maybe the recepies at the end are good to cook?"
2,"Light reading, light in substance","A clichÃ©d storyline based on the classic Cyrano de Bergerac, this book reads like a rookie novel written by someone who has a knowledge and passion for Italian culture and cuisine, but little experience in developing a story. I can understand Bruno and his passion for cooking, but have no clue as to his passion for Laura. It seems to be primarily based on her being a blonde American. How exotic. Her character is so underdeveloped- we know she's studying art history, and she enjoys Bruno's cooking with a passion. That's about it. And Tomasso, he's just the clichÃ© for any over-sexed Mediterranean male who encounters foreign females.It's a light and entertaining read if you can get beyond all of the reasons you should put it down and walk away. That being said, I will, however, check out this author's more recent novels. He does seem to have a way with technical details, hopefully his storytelling has caught up."
2,The food is sexier than the sex,"This book as all about the joy of eating and cooking and love.It's a lot better when it deals with food than with love. In fact, food is not only a metaphor for love and love-making but seems a more than adequate substitute. People have virtual orgasms cooking and eating but the sex is pallid and occasionally positively unappetizing.I can see why this book has been successful but to appreciate it one has to overlook the thin characters and absurd plot, openly cribbed from Cyrano de Bergerac. The most enjoyable parts are the opening chapters. After that, the returns swiftly diminish.Still, for a plane ride, one could do worse I suppose."
5,"I feel ya ""Ghenry187@aol""...this CD rocks. No Limit can't...","I feel ya ""Ghenry187@aol.com""...this CD rocks. No Limit can't touch Cash $ Money Records. I don't know why that new Tru CD sold one million in the first place. Who cares, 'cause I just checked the billboard charts and discovered that Juvenile sold more that two million. So they can't be faded. Anyway, back to this CD. Every song on this CD rocks. My favorite song is ""Help"" by B.G. I love this CD."
3,3 stars for production,"it really pains me to see bone thugs loose to the hot boyz for group of the year at the source awards.everybody was pi$$ed over that robbery.i have a lot of respect for southern rap music.but bone had a far superior album then this album.after that i lost all hope in the source awards.this album have a somewhat solid production value from mannie,but honestly the lyrics are kinda boring.and honestly is no where near as raw as older no-limit albums,and definatley far away from tripple 6 mafia albums."
3,I've heard better.,"Although better than there latest album I didn't care much for Guerilla Warfare. I found alot of the songs on the album to all sound almost exactly the same. It did have some outstanding hot tracks like I need a Hot Girl, Respect my Mind, and Tuesdays and Thursdays but most of the CD was just a bunch of decent tracks nothing that big. If you want to listen to good album by Cash Money get the Big Tymer$ Hood Rich album. That one is much better."
3,Disappointing,Before i say anything about this album Cash Money Records is the Sh*t. I just didn't think this album was very good. The beats and hooks were not what i was expecting. I need a Hot Girl was the best song.
4,HTML The Complete Reference,"This is a book that I read at home, in chunks of 30-45 minutes a night. I highly recommend this book, as both an introduction to HTML, and as a reference for beginner-to-intermediate programmers. It covers HTML in depth, but also mentions CGI, Cold Fusion, ASP, Javascript, and XML, and the role these technologies play in delivering a complete website. The book contains extensive information about Style Sheets, including an entire appendix devoted to the syntax and parameters for Style Sheets."
4,I bought this book after reading these reviews...,"and I have been quite satisfied.Although I don't think a ""Complete"" reference book on programming, especially HTML, can exist, this is as complete and updated as it gets.Being a professional and advanced programmer I might be tempted to claim this as the best book there is, but for beginners I suggest they start with a book which is more of a ""tutorial"" than a ""reference"". A smaller book that puts more emphasis on ""teaching"" the basic concepts than providing an extensive reference resource. But after that I strongly suggest they get this book.Remember, no single programming book can ever be a good reference while being a good tutorial. And we need both."
3,CHECK IT OUT BEFORE YOU BUY IT,"Being a great fan of ff6,I was impatient to listen to this record.At first I thought it was impressive with the orchestra.But then the more I listened to it the more I felt a bit disapointed.I think that some songs dont grasp the original feeling of the game and that some of them dont even respect the original tunes.But you mustnt get me wrong,it still stays a wonderful record,even though it is not totally faithful to the game. Anyway the best advice I can give is to LISTEN TO SOME SONGS BEFORE BUYING IT,to avoid any disapointment."
4,Helpful for sore throat and cough,I have been using this product for years because I have a chronic cough. I think it helps keep my throat moist and helps prevent and alleviate sore throat.
4,"Every time I play it, my friends want a copy. A coming star.",A great guitarist with lots of feeling for his work. Can't wait for his next record!
4,Amazing...,love it...very touch.it's to bad that in the dvd description doesn't mention no subtitles
2,More Romance Please and Less Mystery!!,"the reason i gave two stars when I usually give 5 stars for ms. feehan's books is b/c this book was tooooooo mystery/gothic genre rather than romance. I really didn't feel like the two main characters were in love, in fact the entire book was almost entirely from the heroine's point of view and I was getting sick of her whining and her point of view. unlike the ""dark"" series, you really didnt feel any passion. the book is better suited for the mystery/gothic genre and NOT romance.even the mystery was not that good! its only in the last chapter that for some unforseen reason the villain confesses all in less than three pages. throughout the entire book, you're kept in suspense of who was the bad guy, if you wanted to know who it was look at the last couple of pages....Ms. Feehan, if your reading, please focuse more on the main characters relation to each other rather then distract us with so much unamusing mystery!"
4,Very good romantic read,"This is a very good background book for the Dark Series by Christine Feehan. Very romantic, sometimes a little slow, but still worth reading!!"
5,The Scarletti Curse,"This is another of Christine Feehan brilliant books. She can make you part of that, that is written. You start reading and you can't put it down, I know I couldn't. If you enjoy books of physical,telpathic and romance you will love this. Every time I read one of her books they just get better."
4,Best Camcorder you can buy for under ...,"This is truly an excellent camcorder for home movies and perhaps more advanced applications. I found myself toying around with the nightvision contantly. My only qualms about it was that recording videos to your PC is really dependent on how good a computer you have. For instance, my computer, which is fairly fast would typically have very smooth recording, but every once in a while would skip a few frames, and I would then have to go back and edit it. But don't get me wrong, I truly believe that this really is the best camcorder you can buy for this kind of money, and besides the computer transfer issure, I absolutely love the camera."
4,Fingerprints,"Cornwell takes hold of your mind and does to let go until Scarpetta finds her solution. There is a horrible crime scene but it does produce some fingerprints. This is an easy case for Scarpetta until there is a match. It was a match to murderer that was executed before this murder. Read the book it is a good one. By Ruth Thompson author of ""The Bluegrass Dream"""
4,Review,"This book was a bit more difficult to follow, in my opinion. I was lost toward the end. But Patrica is an awesome writer! I'm sure the problem was me, not her writing."
2,Just Plain Cruel Will Do,"I must say I was required to read this book for a class. If that had not been the case, I would have put the book down half way through it. I was put off by the excessive amounts of technical language and graphic descriptions of the state of murder victims. Quite frankly, I was very disappointed by this book."
5,what happend to Mark?,I just wrote a review on this book and I forgot to include something. WHAT HAPPEND TO MARK. Out of the blue he's all of a sudden dead!
4,Scarpetta has everything you want,One of the best but all Scarpetta are terrific. Love how she continues the characters and creates wonderful story lines in each book. Scarpetta is a must read for crime mystery fans!
4,Spellbound!,"This was my first Patricia Cornwell novel and I must say I was blown away. I never thought I'd warm up to a modern mystery writer the way I did with Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers, but Ms. Cornwell has displaced them both in my heart.C & E was by far the most fascinating book I've ever read. I sat up until the wee hours of the morning reading this wonderful novel, devouring every word, as I couldn't go to bed until I had finished it. The only disappointment was the ending. The killer came out of the blue, and there were too many loose ends.The story and characters were first rate and I intend to read all her other books. It's been a long time since I found an author I would be willing to pay hardcover prices to read."
2,"Too scattered, too shallow","Although this might be a good book to introduce issues in technical writing to someone considering the field, it is not useful if you want anything more than a broad overview. The information it contains varies widely in depth and is sometimes dated; for example, there are several paragraphs discussing the features of dot-matrix printers but only one short and incomplete list of the types of bindings available for professionally printed documentation. For some unclear reason, two sections on editing are separated by 10 pages on usability testing. If you are actually involved in technical writing, there are better books."
4,Apatow's most mature effort...,"... and perhaps that's what made it unpalatable to many of his fans. Characters are extremely well-developed (AND portrayed), there is more heart underneath the expected ""potty humor..."" if Mr. Apatow continues to grow as a writer, I'll continue to watch his movies."
3,"""Funny People"" has a poignant strong beginning and then turns into something completely different in the second act","Length:: 6:20 MinsFunny People is really two movies -- One about Adam Sandler and Seth Rogen....and the other about trying to get back Leslie Mann and a whole bunch of extra drama. The story between the two guys is great, the other story takes away from the first.[...]"
2,"Obviously, not Adam Sandler's best","An acceptable movie, with some good moments by Adam Sandler, and some of the other new American comedy guys; but very far from his really ""funny people"" involved movies, like ""ANGER MANAGEMENT"" (with Jack Nicholson) or the hilarious ""LITTLE NICKY""."
1,profanity the movie!!! or profanity and the degenerates.!!!,"i cannot believe that an intelligent actor like adam sandler would degrade himself by acting in a degenerate , trailer trash movie like this,but i guess money makes some people do things that are beneath them. this movie is as funny as a sewer, all it is comprised of is endless and pointless profanity,virtually ever second word. the writer who has very little ,if not any intelligents, has substituted profanity for lack of intelligent writing.is the endless profanity suppose to make the male lead charactors appear more manly?. yes it is true that quentin tarantino movies has there fair share of profanity. however his movies use of profanity is justified as it is incorporated with intelligent writing. if you have very little or no intelligents or are a degenerate and trailer trash this movie will appeal to you."
1,Depressing then becomes boring,my husband and I watched this and ended up watching something else. this will be a waste of your time
3,Grafic Novels,Our book club tried the Rabbi's Cat to see what all the press concerning new grafic novels. I found it interesting but still prefer when reading a novel to have my own ideas of the people and surroundings. Guess that why after reading a novel I am not impressed with going to a movie with hollywood interruptations.
1,Uneducated Nonsense,"The physics department at my school gets the mad ramblings of this man, and I usually end up with them (seeing as how no one else will read them). In a word, I sum these writings as ""nonsense."" Most of his ideas, aside from being mostly incoherant and physically absurd, also defy the time-tested and true concepts that the average high-school physics student could debunk. Furthermore, mixed in with these insane babblings, are religious and political ramblings, which he tries to pass off as the only possible truth.My recommendation, unless you want a good laugh or evidence of the under-education of many Americans, pass on this book. Any other use of your money would be a better one."
3,"Utter, yet amusing nonsense","John Malatich: the man, the philosophy, the legend. Perhaps only two of the three will suffice to describe this author his magnum opus: ""The Theory of Everything is..."". Unintentionally bizaare, Mr. Malatich expresses his philosophy in swarms of capital letters and misplaced parentheses that invite the reader to vainly delve deeper into the text to find the hidden meanings that are simply not there. Unlike the Codex Sepentarius or the Voynich Manuscript, this work does not use its own script; however, like those two, the inscrutbility of text and alien drawings lend an otherworldly note to the text.Though I'm giving this book a 3/5, do not think that I'm endorsing Mr. Malatich's ideas, as I find them puerile and easily refutable by even the untrained eye. However, taken as a sort of 'art' , this book stands as a brazen testament to the American kook: those who willingly and unabashedly ignore reality in preference to living within its confines."
1,Impossible to read,This kindly adaptation is a mishmash of gibberish. Amazon really needs to take more time in converting these. In this condition this should be free.
2,Still haven't received item,"Bought for my mom for Christmas she loves this perfume and it does actually smell pretty good however I was supposed to recieve my order by the 20th at the latest.its now the night of the 22nd and I am very worried it wont be here for Christmas. UPDATE: Spoke with Amazons customer service and they are replacing my missing item. It will be here tomorrow. Still sucks cuz it wasn't here in time for christmas, however I'm just glad they are replacing it for me."
1,My brain froze over,"This supposed ""thriller"" is mind-numbingly dull and inept - I had to give up half way through."
4,Do we Finally See the End of Temple Gault?,"I read a lot of the reveiws, and I don't agree with quite a few of them. I thought this book was pretty good, and exciting. Yes, the plot is a little thinner than previous books, and yes Kay does wear on one after a time, but the forensics are awesome, and the suspense keeps on and on. I do have to admit that I do tire of Lucy somewhat. To me the books would be better without that added character. In this book Kay, Marino and Wesley are on the trail of the infamous Temple Gault (Kay's long time nemesis). The story is set around the week from Christmas Eve to New Year's Eve, but a lot happens in that short time. We see Kay, Marino and Wesley panicking as they try to nail down what seems to be the most notorious serial killer in the country at that time. Pretty good stuff!"
5,Wonderful!,"This book by Patricia D. Cornwell holds the suspense and mystery as her other six Scarpetta novels, including the new one. It is wonderful because it offers what the reader is looking for if he/she has read other Cornwell novels. If that's what you like, this is what you're looking for"
2,Very Dissapointing,"From Potters Field is one Patricia Cornwell's worst book she has written. It's not the characters, nope. It's not the writing that is wrong. It's the story that makes the book disappointing.Temple Gault has struck again. This time we know this for sure. Both the readers and Kay Scarpetta do. Someone from Lucy's past is also back. The problem with this book is that Gault is not a strong enough villain to carry this book. He is not scary or very threatening. It's not exiting. Partly because we never get into his head we are always inside Scarpetta's. Even if Cornwell did venture inside his head I'm not sure if it would be that exiting. For a killer on the loose plot its very weak, of coarse the forensics are very good and original. But for the most part a very disappointing Scarpetta novel."
3,"adulterous,amoral,atheistic feminist saves the day","Although I enjoy Patricia Cornwell's style andwould have loved to read another of her books,I cannot stand the ""better-than-thou"",militaristic,amoral, atheistic, adulterous lascivious feminismthat is being promoted in this book. My motherand sister are feminists and they go to churchevery week, care for their children and husbands,remain unconditionally faithful to their spouses,carry themselves gently, are very loving and, mostimportantly, desire equal rights with and notsuperiority over men."
3,Disappointing - Not Up to Other Books in This Series,"Let me preface this review by saying I am a fan of Patricia Cornwell and her Scarpetta series. This book, however, is not up to the other books in this series and I was disappointed.This mystery features the same cast of characters as the other Scarpetta mysteries. However, the crazy sadist, Gault, appears to be a caricature of a person. There's one formulaic clue after another and it becomes unbelievable. The protagonist, Kay Scarpetta, is shop-worn and new characters are introduced but never developed. Marino, the politically incorrect, chain-smoking cop is the most real and endearing character in the book.Supposedly a mystery, this book drops clues from the sky, more in line with a fantasy."
2,You sure can tell this was written by an accountant...,"There sure is some exciting literature out there. This is not it. The material is very dry...desert comes to mind. I am using this book for my accounting 211 course at OSU, and boy is it fun (note the sarcasm). And what's with the dates in the example problems (such as 12/31/x1)? What is that? Were they too afraid to put a 9 in there? They didn't think we, the students, could handle it? But hey, I'm not bitter or anything. I don't even think you COULD make accounting interesting. A must read! (HA!)"
5,Haizlitt takes a shot across the bow of bogus mathematic economics,"In the tradition of Bastiat's - The Law, Haizlitt slays his philosophical opponents with clear, biting truth; and, packs it all into 100-odd pages. Especially appropriate given the time period in which it was penned, Haizlitt effectively puts to rest Keynesian notions of mathematical precision and makes the best case for economic freedom produced in the 20th century. Highly readable...a ""Human Action"" for the masses."
3,Good book.. but a little misleading.,"This book is most definitely an interesting read; however, I bought it with the purpose of helping me in a Microeconomics class. This book isn't about teaching you basic economics. It's more of an opinion piece. So buyer beware - if you're looking for an educational, informational, technical book about economics, this one won't fit the bill."
2,NO Help,This book did not help me with my economics class. Even though I passed the course with a B. This book reads more like a novel and really does not simplify economics at all. I work better with definitions and examples and this book gives none.
2,Too simplistic,"Although though we're (presumably) members of the same political choir, the author treats economics much too simplistically.Calling this book a polemic on Keynesian economics would be accurate, calling it an economics treatise would be just plain wrong.Time would be better spent reading Bastiat."
1,No lessons learned,"This is one of the most disappointing purchases I have made on Amazon.The book is one long, myopic, libertarian apology."
4,Read the angry anti-Hazlitt reviews for a real indication,"I think beyond the fact that Hazlitt produces a succinct and well-argued explanation for why free markets are the best arrangements in economic relationships, what is really wonderful is reading the screeds of those readers that he pisses off! Read the rabid ranting temper tantrum of the one reader who amazingly was accepted to the University of Chicago and you can see how ideas that actually support free thought and productive profitable endeavors drive lunatics like this crazy - its awesome!! This dork probably marches against the WTO."
4,TMNT Soundtrack,I love the songs on this CD. Some of the songs make me want to run fast and punch stuff.
2,not quite what I was expecting,"I originally bought one of Daniel's previous albums (the title had 'insomniac' in it). the previous album was mostly acoustic with melodic vocals. I bought it for my wife. she loved it. Next year, I purchased deflaboxe and the CD got thrown back at me. This album was NOTHING like the previous album I had purchased for her. so if you are like me and buying this album based on his previous work, think again. he took a completely different style with this album."
2,Nineteen folktales of South and Central America,"This children's book is a collection of nineteen folk tales collected and retold by the author from his travels throughout Central and South America. The book won the 1925 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature. I am oviously in the minority with my opinion: I only awarded the book two stars. I simply found it boring. But, this is obviously a good resource of South American folktales. Perhaps those who enjoy such material will like the book more than I."
4,Good choice for getting a vintage look,"I have the nude version of this chincher in small.I favour a vintage pinup look every day so the small waist is a main focus. I do have vintage styled cinchers and other authentic shapewear but they are expensive. This is a perfect substitute for day to day wear.As said in annother review you cannot wear this under clingy slinky clothes as it does ripple up at the front.I would recomend wearing a slip under it to avoid skin irritation. I wear a corset liner available from waist training specialists.The length is fine on me, going from just below the bra line down to the hip bones (I am 5ft 4)The cinching effect takes about 1.5 - 2 inches off my waist comfortably, enough to get into my vintage dior.I do not wear it enough to comment on the claims of permenant inch loss...but I think I will give it a try."
4,Not for people with short torsos,"I am 5'6"", but I have a long torso. That resulted in a 2"" section of skin/fat that was squeezed out of the bottom of this thing. I ordered their vest to see if it would be a better fit for me. 4-stars though, because it did actually work, and appeared to have sturdy construction. It was a bit constricting at first, and it definitely felt good to take it off at the end of the night and breathe deeply--but it helped me look much better in a tight-fitting cocktail dress than I looked alone or with spanx!"
3,Sizing is inconsistent,"I ordered two different styles of the Squeem but the sizing is inconsistent. You may wear one size in one product and a total different size in the other even though it is fitting the same body part. Strange. Also, the edges of the product rubs against my skin and leaves bruises. I look like I got in a fight with a Tiger and lost."
4,Works,"I was very skeptical about this. When I do wear it,it does work. It takes some getting used to."
4,Magic,"After 3 c sections, I need all the help I can get. I started with the size Large (when I was a size 12). I have moved on to the medium (I am between 8-10 now). The medium is REALLY tight, but does the job. I prefer the large day to day because I have 3 children under 6 to run after, and it is a bit more comfortable for that. These things are really great. I can't believe I didn't know about them after my first 2 c sections. They should send all women home with them after giving birth!"
4,Does it what it claims!,Took off a few inches of my waist and kept it there! A bit tough to get used to so I recommend using a tank top under the squeem.
3,My Squeem,"I've been wearing my squeem off/on for about 2-3 weeks. I haven't noticed a change in my waist size but when I have it on, I look really good. It gives me that nice curve that I usually don't have. I've not given up hope on it yet."
2,Would be great but...,"The package says it goes from lower belly to just under bust. I am a short woman and it doesn't reach my ribs leaving me with two huge rolls of fat on the front and back. It takes me in great, love that about it but because it isn't long enough I can't wear it anywhere:("
3,Okay,"I purchased this product for postpartum compression, and I only found it to be okay. The sizing puzzled me as I seemed to fit into 3 different sizes - XS for dress size, M for actual measurement, and S is right there in the middle. I ended up with the medium which fits but I think I should have purchased the small. I also purchased the belly bandit, and for postpartum compression I would much prefer that product. I do agree that the squeem makes for a good shape and it is comfortable to wear."
2,Burn Rubber on Me,"I went by the Squeem chart and my waist measurements to find the correct size but to my suprise the waist cincher did not fit. Warning, you cannot return for a refund; only merchandise credit/exchange. Also, the cincher smelled like burnt rubber. Very bulky and will be visible through clothing so you cannot wear with tight fitting clothing."
2,Not worth the price...,"I bought this to slim down my tummy under a bridesmaid dress. First, it smelled horrific and still stunk like rubber after washing. Second, it did almost nothing to slim me down, even though I bought the suggested size. Third, after about a half hour of wearing it, it was absorbing sweat and making me feel clammy and uncomfortable. It was extremely uncomfortable to sit down in, and the boning showed through the relatively thick cotton of the dress. I abandoned it completely and felt much better."
2,Why does everybody rave when....,"This product sucks!It doesn't completely suck... the 2 days I was able to wear it before the boning snapped in half it did compress pretty tight. As many people have noted, it is HELL to get into this the first time.I liked that this wasn't a body suit and the rubber on the outside would keep my shirt from sliding up.BUTThis garment:1) Rides up- if you move a lot it will eventually slide up your waist2) Leaves a huge crease on the skin above your waist-- and it hurts3) Makes you look like a sausage when you sit down: visually divides your belly in half when you sitAs I said I only wore this twice, first time I wore it for about half hour and the second time I had worn it for several hours when the boning snapped in half and was poking into my side (ouch!! )RETURNING THIS!!!"
2,Not OK!!!,"When I ordered this I thought it would allow me to wear some clothes that I haven't been able to do in a while because of my weight gain.I am a woman who has size 40D in breasts so I wear a large in tops and I wear a size 8 in pants, and weight 140lbs. It is suppose to clinch your waist and give you a nice looking figure. Well, it did hug my waist, but it also gave my a muffin top. Not a shape a woman wants to have. I looked better without wearing it. It folds into your folds creating a bigger fold at the top of your body. I would say this item is more for the extremely skinny female who has small breasts', no hips, or ass. Not for a woman who has large breast, hips, and ass. Not for women who are going through post-pregnancy either. For a product thats is suppose to make you feel good about yourself, it failed."
3,Really Helps with Muffin Top,"This product is OK. The ideal behind it is great, but in my case it needs to be longer I think. I'm not tall about 5'6"" & weight about 155. After I get it on there is a roll between the bottom of my bra and the top of the waist cincher. It would be alright if your shirt isn't very snug, but isn't that the whole purpose of the waist cincher, to be able to wear jeans, shirts & dresses that are a little close fitting. It does help with the hang over with the lower cut jeans. Its just hard to wear a tight fitting shirt with them. Other than that it works pretty good. Would like to try the squeem vest to eliminate the roll between bra & waist cincher."
4,No more love handles!,"I like this product. I suffer from chronic love handles especially when I wear jeans. I am 5'1"" and 122 pounds. I bought a medium because I tried my friend's small and it was way too tight for me. The medium fits well. It does get a bit hot. I love the way it hides my love handles."
1,WASTE OF MONEY: The inner metal rods keep poking through,"The squeem is a great idea but the construction is not the best. While the product compresses your stomach, the inner metal spines bend and then protrude at the ends. I have had to sew the ends repeatedly but the spines keep poking through. At one point, the spine developed some sort of crack and when it poked through the bottom, it scraped my stomach and I took it off immediately. I have never washed the product in the washing machine...I have always handwashed it. So, the manufacturer can't say that I didn't take good care of it."
4,The hype is true,"I only just started wearing this today but already I know I'm going to be wearing it daily, and without discomfort. I'm 6 weeks postpartum and really needed something to help me shrink back down to my former size and I do believe this WILL do the trick.So far, the hype is true. It doesn't roll down on the edges and it really evens out the figure very nicely - even under clothes you can't tell you are wearing this. I guess a con would be that I can see how you'd get sweaty wearing this all day long and especially in hot weather.Overall, I am impressed so far."
4,Very sturdy,This item is very sturdy and holds in the belly area better than another softer belt I have. The measurements seem true to size and there are two rows of hooks so you can adjust if you lose some weight.The only negative points are that the item smells badly of rubber when new. It must be washed before wearing. The other is that all that rubber can make you sweat. But those are minor complaints if you want to look good for an evening. The belt also helps me sit straight so I think it's good for the back as well as the front.
5,Bad posture no more,I bought this product because it promised to help improve bad posture and it does. Even when I am not wearing it I find myself sitting more erect than I used to. I love it!
1,I got burned after few hours wearing it,"the first day,( 8 hours wearing it ) it hurt me so bad , my skin was torned, itched, swell, deep red. I tried to wear other side, after few hours, I got deep burned both on the right and left belly, the skin was torned, swell, bleeding, lot of cross cut on the skin, itched for a week until now. It looked like I was beaten up or have skin disease...I am scared to dead when I look at it now. I don't know why I got it , I used something like this before, but I didn't get any bad thing. or the rubber hurt me ?"
2,nice product,My wife loves it but we unfortunately perchaced the wrong size. She made a coment about the sizing chart being in dress sizes and she picked the size she is and we received it and the apparel was way too small. We have been meaning to exchange it but its tough to get time being as we have new born twins. That's why she wanted the apparel. She was really excited to receive the part and was disappointed when it didn't fit.
3,Should have ordered a medium,"I went back and forth over whether or not I should purchase a small or a medium. My waist measured at 30"" just right there on the cusp. I ended up ordering the small and had the hardest time getting the booger on! And oh man UNCOMFORTABLE! Yes, it cinched my waist, but the areas that weren't inside the squeem bulged out grossly e.g. above the squeem, had a nice fat roll below my bra, not attractive and could not be hidden. I looked like a nightmare in clothes. I also didn't like that it didn't cinch my hips, meaning my pants didn't fit any better. It did make my waist tiny and gave me an hourglass figure, which I have never had before. In the long run it's getting returned. It just didn't give me the silhouette I wanted, and I don't think any amount of wearing it is going to do that."
2,Not what I expected,"This product was not what I expected so I returned it. Too tight, sizing was misleading. I'll stick with my Spanx."
3,Sheet is not poka dots !!!,"This is a very heavy cotton, almost too thick. It is strpped blue just like the picture. I was thinking the picure was just another style and the one ordered would be poka dots since that is the title. I have a little girl so the blue stipes don't go. You are ordering the exact picture above so no dots!!"
3,Color much more bright orange,The picture looks like a burnt warm orange but these are Bright orange. I really don't like the color but too much trouble to return.
3,good product,wish the product description had included where it was made. it was made in china. it is a well made product.
1,Horrible,This movie was horrible. It did not play right when I was watching it online. I liked how it went by old vampire styles. Such as crosses worked and you had to invite them in and such. But the ending was really bad. Do not waste your money on this one. Also the storyline did not really make much sense.
4,Good puzzle,"This is a good puzzle-but you have to put the pieces in correctly or they don't fit well. I work with kids who have autism and this frustrates them sometimes. Otherwise, it is very durable and I use it a lot."
5,yeah!,"Rhapsody in blue is a cool song, i guess. i'm listening to the song right now for the first time. it's cool. ,e sp driml"
3,Better Than Most Higgins Tales,"Edge of Danger is a step above a number of recent Jack Higgins tales. The protaginist - Sean Dillon, must track down a dangerous Middle Eastern billionaire before he can reek havoc on the world. While prior to 11 September, this book is relevant to our crisis. Higgins does a nice job bringing out more dimensions of Dillon and some of the other good guys. The author bumbles a chance to knock off a key character - losing the opportunity to add some tension and passion to the survivors. Incredibly, this person takes three bullets and lives. The plot is solid and fast paced. My only problem is with the enemies. They are too cold and their motives are weak. The key assaisin could audition for the Key Stone Cops. Don't get me wrong, the Edge of Danger is a good yarn. I hope Higgins continues to improve the depth and reality of his characters. I look forward to the next edition."
1,"Actually, this book is not worth one star.","This is my very first book review. Because this book is so fundamentally wrong I need to speak up. The main character Sean Dillion, formal IRA, has a license to kill and make the killing like a game rather than justice. He does whatever he wants to do without follow orders nor has any boundary. He pickup a couple of his terrorism/criminal partners making killing like a habits, terrorism competition, fun game and egoism fulfillment. It so far from any common sense such as the British General could not control this maniacal killer and let he kills who he wish to kill or threaten his masculinity. The killings like a joke to him and have absolutely no legal consequence. This book has promote violence behavior has no artist nor entertainment value. I lost my interest in Jack Higgins Sean Dillion's serial after finishing this ridicules book."
1,Edge of Danger by Jack Higgins,I was a big fan of Jack Higgins adventures until this book! I think this book reads like a poorly written condensed version of a good story - or like the outline of a book. It jumped around too abruptly with poorly written dialogue - no conversation was stretched into a normal length of exchange between people. It was difficult to keep track of all the minor characters in the book because none of them were well developed. I will proabably never read another Jack Higgins book. I am very disappointed - just like I got with Robert Ludlum in one of his later novels. I have never read another book of his either.
3,Only If You Really Love Higgins,"Look. I can't really disagree with the other reviews. However, I enjoyed this book. If you, as have I, read every Sean Dillon book in the series you will enjoy spending a few hours with these characters who have become so familiar after so many years. Great literature? Not a chance. A good read for fans of Jack Higgins? Definitely!!!!"
4,Good matt nude lipstick,It's got a nice warm scent of vanilla-like smell. Texture is creamy. Meadow Sweet is a nice nude color. Can't apply too much or else it'll look a bit dry.
2,needs $$ upgrade,Only has limited access to OBDII data stream unless you pay more money to upgrade the software.
2,The Scarlett Letter,Written in old English. It was very hard to read as I had to think through most sentences to figure out what was being said.
3,scarlet letter,Thought I was getting a book received book on tape. a little deceiving. Rather than that the process went as expected. If it had been what we wanted would have been great.
2,ok...,this book was recommend 2 me from my neighbor. but i dont think that dis is dat gud of a book 2 recommend... i didnt like it 2 much but...
4,we all have opinioms...,"I believe that this is a fantastic book for those who have more distinguished tastes. As for others, it is a slow read with challenging vocabulary."
4,Great read,I always liked this book. The kindle version is kind of difficult to navigate but it does its purpose. I can still go back to my last read without any problem.
5,The Great American Novel,"Hawthorne wrote a masterful work of historical fiction incorporating an examination of guilt, revenge and suffering in the context of Puritan Salem. Here is a book that speaks to any age about timeless themes. The Scarlet Letter is one of those books that may have force fed to one during grade school but revisited from the perspective of adulthood it is a very fine example of great writing from a true American master."
4,"Great Condition, Almost Exactly What I Expected","I was quite pleased with the condition of this book, as well as it's hardcover, and the footnotes, definitions, and reading reviews for beginner readers of the genre. I am, of course, a huge fan of the Scarlet Letter itself and this copy served its purpose well. One of the few disappointments was that the color of the cover seems to look a little more coral, or pink, than scarlet or red. Also, the back cover is white, and I am most definitely one for appearances. I would have like a slightly more classic looking cover. Nonetheless, the binding will look fair on my bookshelf. Over all the book was clean and well taken care of, and was shipped to me with great haste; A Good Buy."
3,First try at electronic book,I know this is a classic but I just could not get into the story. Thought I would try electronic books but I need the paper feel when reading.
3,re: slow but fascinatingly enchanting...,"I did not read much of this book, however, I do remember some of it. Often when I discuss comparative literature, I tend to use the example of Charlse Dickens's ""A Tale of Two Cities"", for in Dickens's famous novel, there are about five hundred pages of mere background information. And so, we have the style of Nathaniel Hawthorne presented to us: he is, in essence, a lover of symbolism and all things literarily analyzed. I really got into the story when the first pyre scene happened... Now, note, when I said pyre I meant pillar, for pyres are something entirely different and generally greek/medieval... Anyway, as I was saying, Hawthorned loves literary symbolism and creativity. I love the way he ended the plot, but I think that the story line could have moved a little faster, thus giving ""The Scarlet Letter"" a Dickens-like quality."
2,The Scarlett Letter is too verbose.,"I had to read The Scarlett Letter for my honors english 3 class. I found that the author was too verbose in describing people, places, situations, and just the story in general. The book was so wordy, I often found myself forgetting the topic of that particular paragraph. Also, I was disturbed to find out that ever day the Reverand A. Dimmesdale would beat himself, and stay up till the early morning hours!"
1,"Historically accurate it may be, but a boring read.","I read this ""Classic"" novel for a class, and must admit I was thoroughly disappointed. Hawthorne should have stuck to writing non-fictional books about the Puritan settlers. This book was a pill. There are so many American authors, and novels that could be taught in schools that could far exceed the entertainment level of this out of date story. Two thumbs down."
4,An Old-Time Soap Opera,"I am not one who enjoys romance, however Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter is truely an unshakable landmark in American Literature. Unlike most people, I read this novel in college (I don't know why junior high teaches this book; it's way to advanced for that intensity of reading) and depicted it as a soap opera in Puritan society. The novel inhibits sex, suspense, drama, and romance all in one pakage. I found the invidious Roger Chillingwoth to be an extremely interesting aspect about the novel's well-rounded plot. The theme of the novel is sin, and how tragically easy it could destroy a normal town denizen. I mean, all 3 main characters are virtually consumed and eventually destroyed by their own private sins. Read this book; by doing so, one will appreciate truly powerful literature that still shakes our foundation today."
4,ok,i liked good book from the past....great that we can look back on these great books and enjoy them .
4,AAAAAAAAAA,"Scarlet Letter is a kind of book that you understand it and you love it or you dont understand it and hate it. I think this deserves four stars because of the idea of the book. A stand for adultry in this book and tells the story of puritans in that time period. Hester and Pearl faces lots of insult in this community and if you want to find out whot the secret father of Pearl is READ the BOOK!!! But I would recommend to read this book after you are 14 years, because the Idea of the book is too matured."
2,One word: outdated,"This book is one of the last masterpieces written as American literature moved from what we call ""Old English"" (use the much cliched Olde if you must) to ""New English."" And trust me, it shows. Virtually every book ever written during this period, (essentially, before Twain's Huckleberry Finn), bears the same markings - incredibly lavish diction, complex structure and syntax, and all the elements that make for a generally hard to follow novel. If you elevate your reading to that next level, where you're seeing beyond the simple plot and percieving Hawthorne's masterful use of symbolism and metaphor, and are able to appreciate probably the last great novel written in before the literary revival of the late 1800s, then you'll consider this book a worthwhile read."
1,Painful,"This book has to be one of the most tedious works of literature ever written. Hawthorne is a great writer, but I don't know how this book made it into that sacred list we call ""classics"". Perhaps on the merit of his name alone?"
4,"A Passionately Written Book, But It Does Happen to Bore Me","The Scarlet Letter shows Nathaniel Hawthorne at his finest. The imagery is quite wonderful, but there's only so many times you can say the same thing. The images in this novel stretch out far longer than needed.I nearly couldn't make it through. I do like to see every detail given it's fullest attention but even this is too much.This book is one that is very vivid and quite pleasing to understand, but hard to read and not as easy to follow. Sometimes there's only one resourceful fact in a half a page paragraph.Recommended."
3,Ehh,Thie book isnt terrible I had to read it for my AP English class and so far it has been the easiest read. I would recommend it to anyone who likes books of that time frame.. The language uses a lot of thee's and thou's
1,Horrible reader,i couldn't listen to this book because the women reading it has such a screechy horrible voice so i can give no review of the actual book but whatever you do try to find a version with a different reader if you're into audio books
3,It was OK,"I've always wanted to read this and when I got the chance, I was a bit disappointed. The language was difficult for me to grasp and there were few scenes that I understood what was going on. After reading this, I don't understand why it is a classic. Although the message of the book was clear, the Shakespeareian-style writing was hard for me to understand."
3,Can't compete with peer works,"I finally got around to reading this classic work last year and was quite disappointed. I tend to limit my reading these days to two primary realms, classic literature and early 20th Century fiction, and this one just didn't measure up to the standard set by other famous authors of Hawthorne's day.It's a simple story about scandal and I guess I was expecting so much more. I wish I could say it was superbly-written but I think that it reflects a lack of committed effort on Hawthorne's part."
3,"Glad I read it, but probably wouldn't read it again","I liked this book as I was reading it. It was really interesting to see Puritan life through Hester Prynne's eyes. I think one reason that I liked it has to do with the fact that I skipped reading the first part, ""The Custom House."" I didn't read it when the teacher told the class to read it, and I wrote a paper on it and got an A.All in all, a good book, but I don't think I would've gotten through more than half of it if I hadn't been pushed into it by my English class. Looking back, though, I'm glad I read it because a lot of other works have some thing(s) in common with ""The Scarlet Letter,"" and it would be a shame to graduate with a degree in English without reading it."
1,Horrific forced reading,"I will never understand why they force this book on school children, I'm sure there are many other ""classic"" stories that could be included in the curriculum."
4,If you read this book you will be amazed,Well I read this book and it amazed me. The first time I read this book I thought it was stupid. page after page it got better. Well this book is about a girl who commits an adultery. The girl's name is Hester. So she gets an A on her dress and she goes to prison. Her husband left her like a coward. and I don't want to ruin the story so I will recomend this book to anyone who wants a good read. When I read this book i thought it was hard comepare to the books LORD OF THE FILES and THE ANIMAL FARM. so just read THE SCARLET LETTER.
3,For an audience,"Hawthorne has written a book deeply in psychological symbolism and wordy sentences. This book is for those with enough patience to let a deluded, complex story develop -- not a story for me, even though I have read many in the genre."
4,The Scarlet Letter a must read for any American,"The best book that I have ever been assigned to read for school by far. The way in which Hawthorne captures the shame that Hetser , the wearer of the scarlet letter, feels everyday and the utter torment that the weak Dimmesdale is in by not coming forth and saying he slept with Hester and the revenge ridden character of Chillingworth is spectactular.The way in which Hawthorne describes the setting and the actions that characters do is truly outstanding. Hawthorne has a huge flare for the dramatic which is great for the reader. Since Hester the main character concieved her daughter Pearl through an affair she has been snetenced to wear the scarlet A on her chest for the rest of her life. The story starts on the day Hester is to stand infront of the town and wear her badge of shame and all the drama in the small puritanical town of Boston starts from there. A must read for any American."
3,Good Book,"I, as a 10th grade student, had to read The Scarlet Letter for school. at first, what came to mind was ""this is going to be the most boring, hard to read book ever, as most school books are."" I started reading it and my nightmares were coming true. i didn't understand half of what Hawthorne was trying to say. this really put me down but once we started discussing the chapters that we had read, i realized what it was about and how good it actually is. Once i knew more about the story, reading became much easier. (some parts, though were just plain tedious.) the imagry that was used was amazing and the plot was excelent. i would have given more stars but some of it was just too complicated and i couldn't follow it.Bottom line: everyone should read this book because it is a classic for a reason. (it really is a good book) but you might want to get a guide to it or maybe cliffnotes so it is esier to understand."
1,A sin to humanity,"No, I'm not talking about Hester's crime. I'm talking about this STUPID BOOK! If only Hawthorne had kept his job in the customs house (see prologue), this abomination would never have been spawned from the cess-ridden depths of Hawthorne's twisted thinking organ. (You can figure THAT out on your own). This book is untolerably boring (the only proven cure of insomnia - if you don't mind the side effects) and the descriptions are ridiculously entangling. In the words of Mr. Hawthorne himself, this book is ""ignominiously"" dull. PRESERVE YOUR SANITY! NEVER READ THIS! NEVER!I sleep now..."
2,Looooooooooooooooong.,"If you can read and readily understand old-english, you *may* be able to enjoy this novel.I found it painfully long and didn't even care to finish it, which is unheard of for me!"
2,Not What it is Made Out to be...,"It shocks me that the Scarlet Letter is the most taught book in the nation. It may have much symbolism and so on, but it is a convoluted mess. The author is completely detached from his audience, and for some bizarre reason, he feels he has to explain every little thing that happens in great detail. It is also irrelevant to our modern times. In our days people need to be reading things like Huxley, Orwell, Fitzgerald, Bradbury, Hemmingway, Steinbeck, Salinger, and many other great 20th century writers. This book is only relevant to those interested in the time period which it discusses."
4,Good One Book Night of Entertainment,"Quick read because the book is really a short story and some of the character language can be annoying but necessary per the theme of the novel . Interesting read especially since the book was written in the late 1800s but set in our future. Not your typical ""end of the world"" novel with all the ""glitter"" and multiple story lines like Earth Abides (same genre) but for being written so long ago the author hit the nail on the head per the cascading long-term effects of a ""Scarlet"" event."
5,Scarlet Letter,a classic book where there is really nothing bad to say about. AS an adult though one can appreciate it more because we choose to read the book instead of it being an assignment that needs to be completed for school.
3,I Don't See the Big Deal,"I had to read this book, which I had heard quite a bit about, for school but after reading it I had no idea why it is considered such a classic. There is no question that the language is old-fashioned and difficult, but that isn't the only problem I found with it. The whole story was rather boring. It seemed that the author tried to make a lightweight story about an affair and the child that was a product of it deeper or more important by describing how the characters felt. The book was not exactly bad, but, like many other books, it does not really deserve its status as a classic. I saw it more as a book that showed somewhat the morals and ideas of the Puritans. While it is good in that sense, I don't think that it is very important in modern times, and it certainly wasn't a fun read."
3,The Scarlet Letter,"This book was purchased for my daughter for a class. I remember reading it in high school and yeap, still almost as drawn out as it was back then. We both think the same thing. But, a good read nonetheless."
1,unfinishable,"A classic? Hardly. In it's time this book may have ruffled feathers but these days it's a struggle to get through. Hawthorne's writing style is dreary and dreadful; if captivating readers was his aim, he failed miserably."
4,Pretty Good.,"The whole time reading The Scarlet Letter I thought that it was just extremely interesting. The characters were well-developed and at times, endearing. The way that Hawthorne is able to describe the torture that Reverend Dimmesdale undergoes is very believable. Although I am only thirteen years old and have never committed adultery, I find it easy to relate to Hester Prynne. And Pearl, my most favorite of all the characters, just adds a very interesting touch to the story. Despite the good characters, I did not like the fact that during most of the book, parts of the main plot are dismissed for chapters at a time to describe something not always commpletely relevent to the story. But, overall, I thought this book was very interesting, and would definately take the time to read it."
1,Does not have true plumeria scent,"I used to live in Hawaii. Plumerias were abundant, both growing and leis. I was excited to have that scent again in a lotion. The lotion itself is your average body lotion consistency. However, there is NO way that this is a true plumeria scent. I would not order their other ""Plumeria"" products (which are more expensive)based on this lotion."
4,The best tomato flick,"This is IMHO the best of the 4 Killer Tomato flicks. We even get to see Gary Condit briefly (from the back) in the pizza parlor fight scene!Without spoiling the surprises, I'll just say that the movie features a very sexy tomato who was once a real tomato."
5,Best one in Tomato Trilogy,"Return of the Killer Tomatoes is hilarious. Anthony Starke is great. J. Stephen ""Rock"" Peace is back as Lt. Wilbur Finletter. This is the best movie in the Killer Tomato Triolgy."
1,Unreadable!,"As good as this book may be, the print quality is so bad that I cannot read it. Zero stars would have been more appropriate."
3,"OK, but you'd better know what you're doing","All of the screws need to be double-nutted to keep them from backing out due to vibration. Replacement lamps are difficult to find, my husband ended up using 12v marker lamps from an auto parts store. Eats sidewalls for breakfast on skinny-tired bikes. A piece of 3/4"" air hose slipped over the wheel makes it able to run on the rim instead.The rear light is made to mount to a fender, FYI."
5,NEED A LAUGH!!!!!,IF YOU NEED A GOOD LAUGH THIS IS THE ONE. I DON'T LIKE ANIMATED MOVIES BUT THIS IS SOOOOOOO FUNNY. THE CHARACTERS AND HUMOR CAN'T MAKE YOU FEEL SAD AT ALL. A GOOD FLICK AFTER A TOUGH DAY AT THE OFFICE.
3,JUST CUZ IT'S A CARTOON,"Just cuz it's a cartoon, and about the holiday's, does not make it a family movie. The movie was everything I expected, no real surprises. That said I do not feel the adult content shuold be used to grade the movie. My kids will not be seeing this for some time. My copy has PG-13 PARENTS STRONGLY CAUTIONED clearly stated on the back."
2,Two Tedious Hours,"The early success of Adam Sandler's films gave him this mistaken impression that he was an actor and a writer. This film proves he is neither - and a grating voice-over guy to boot. I enjoyed Happy Gilmore and to a much lesser degree, Little Nicky and Big Daddy. But Sandler is a one-trick pony. We've all seen the trick, so it's just not interesting anymore. I thought this might be the one Hanukah film in a world of X-mas fare. It has nothing to do with the holiday and is definitely not for kids."
3,"So stupid, its funny","I went to my sisters boyfriends house, and his roomate bought a couple of DVDs and this was one of them. I saw it, it wasnt boring, but it was stupid and it was funny, I expected more from this film, but its worht watching if like comedy and Adam Sandler."
1,The thrid in a string of flops for Sandler,Eight Crazy Nights is the thrid back to back unfunny movie(following Little Nicky and Mr Deeds) that Adam Sandler has made in the past two years. Eight Crazy Nights is full of toiler humor and unfunny one-liners. I may have laughed once or twice if these movie. They should have called Eight Crazy Ways to ruin a comic's carrer.
4,Eight Crazy Nights,"Adam Sandler is one of our favourite actors,and this is such a funny movie for all ages why would you not want it in your collection.Some may think its a bit much for children under 5,But my children 9+ loved to see Christmas cheers and a drunken fool wake up to the real world and how not everybodys life is bliss.It was a great movie to laugh, watch and learn all in one."
1,Sandler Strikes Out,"8 Crazy Nights might have been a sweet film with a good message for kids, but the scatological humor, offensive language and explicit sexual references made it unsuitable for my 10-year old. The plot, on the other hand, while fine for 10-year olds was too obvious and simplistic for most of the adults in the audience. As a result, while it's probably not the worst film of the year, it is certainly in the running."
1,Inappropriate for young children,"In two of the episodes, the word ""shut up"" is used. My son is three years old and instantly picked up on it, repeated it, and told me it was a bad word, but that James and Duck (the trains) had said it. I would stay away from this one, especially if you have young, impressionable youngsters. I gave it one star, since the wooden dragon train came with it."
1,Presley's Worst Film,"""Spinout"" (1966) represents the nadir of Elvis Cinema - a bad sitcom without the laugh track. The only redeeming features are a few memorable songs, such as ""I'll Be Back"" and ""Stop, Look and Listen."" Buy the soundtrack and skip the movie."
2,NOT A GOOD SPIN FOR PRESLEY,"This is not Presley's best vehicle but by this outing he was not being allowed to act anyway so he appears to be just going though the motions. The movie songs are not a real treat either, he seems to be singing to everyone including his enemies. (Where does the music come from when he sings anyway). When asked to do this movie Presley should have ""JUST SAID NO""!!!"
5,Love KidKraft,"I love this desk! In fact, I have two! One for my daughter and one for my son. They are beautiful, flawless and go together easily. They are sturdy and should last a many years. So happy with this purchase!"
1,Skip it - buy the full sized version,This one makes too small and too fine a grind of pepper to be useful in cooking. You'll be cranking away on this thing for ten minutes before you get enough crushed pepper to flavor anything.
