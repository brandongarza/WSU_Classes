1,The Secret and Seven Habits of Highly Successful People,STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED THIS PART OF My ORDER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WOULD LOVE TO RECEIVE IT.
5,Phenomenal. A true gem and a life changer.,"At first glance the seemingly over the top reviews convinced me to purchase this book. After just finishing it a few moments ago, I must say that the reviews haven't given it justice. This is truly a life-changing experience, which allowed me to get back on track. Starting from an almost, if not entirely, narcissistic standpoint I am now humbled. A must read and a true hand book for living."
4,Unique among motivational books,"This book is unique among most of the self-improvement books published in the last century because ""7 habits"" focuses on what Covey calls ""The Character Ethic"" instead of what he calls ""The Personality Ethic"". The Personality Ethic states that success is a function of public image, attitude, and the process of human interaction. Covey believes that The Personality Ethic focuses on the superficial, rather than the underlying problem of character. The Character Ethic states that the foundation of success is made up of attributes like fairness, integrity, honesty, and patience. Components of The Personality Ethic naturally flow out of a person who is rooted in the principles of The Character Ethic.Instead of focusing on specific motivation strategies, Covey focuses on creating the mindset a person needs before they can be motivated. I can't reccommend this book enough."
1,Ugh,I did not enjoy this book at all. Your time would be better spent sharpening a saw...literally. Go buy a saw and learn how to sharpen it.
1,7 Habits of Highly Effective People,"I freely give glowing positive reviews when they are deserved, and you can find plenty of my positive reviews elsewhere, -but you won't find one here! I spend a lot of time traveling in my car and I remember this as a very long and boring day that I gave to listening to all these twisted-around, rehashed, ""original"" ideas. Come on! Get serious! Anyone who is capable of thinking can have results equal to, or greater than those discussed here. This CD was not expensive, but I feel this was a complete waste of my time, and will be of your too if you go ahead and buy it. You don't need this CD. -Try honestly thinking for yourself."
4,Begin with the end in mind.,I am half way reading this book now or must I say experiencing it. I can recommend it already to everbody.
2,Stupid Book!,Did not like this book. I feel it is poorly written and very hard to understand. It was required reading for a course I was taking in culinary school. Don't buy it if you don't have to.
1,An invaluable book,"My life was changed by this book. I find Covey succesfully integrates a bleeding obvious paradigm into a work orientated lifestyle scenario schedule overview bla bla bla. Amusing diagrams of circles around other circles with arrows pointing in. Then the same ones with different colours or the arrow reversed just in case you didnt understand the obvious points. If you like this book buy ""Should I drink poison or not"", ""Is Godzilla real"", ""How to make commone sense sound like a deep philosophy by using the word paradigm"" etc."
5,The Best Self-Educating Book,This Book Uncovers and Defines all the peculiarities of internal and external behavior. if you focus and take notes of the ideas mentioned you can make big changes in your life. I Highly Recommend this Book for anyone willing to enhance the quality of his life and has the courage to identify his weaknesses. Especially Useful to Middle East and 3rd world People.
1,please do not buy this book,"I am a positive person and have never once written a bad review. The ""author"" takes such basic subects and tries to build a paragraph with them. Stretching it out with repetiveness and a million and one unnecessary words. I tried so hard to read this book but simply could not. I became bored very quickly and almost felt anger that this man had taken MY hard earned money!!! 40 pages would have been ample to cover what this person has blown out over 300 plus pages. It is NOT a book....simply a pile of paper with a cover......sorry to be so negative."
5,STRATEGIES FOR EFFECTIVENESS,Stephen Covey outlines the best strategies for maximum effectiveness in this great book. The fact that this book has remained a best seller for over 15 years should tell you something about the merits of the informmation that it contains.Highly recommended book.
5,"A MUST READ, USEFUL, APPLICABLE,TIMELESS, TRASCENDENT","The wisdom of the seven habits, moves us to another platform of thinking and seing our human condition and our interations with other people.Its phylosophy is so pragmatical and valuable in every arena of life.Definitely, a classical and acclaimed book that will serve to build the highly competitive organizations of the 21th century.Ultimately it will contribute to the improvement society and development our soul."
5,great book!,Great book with lots of principles applicable to all areas of life. Highly recommend this book!
4,"Not an Audio ""Book""","This isn't the book word for word. Rather it is a lecture on the habits by the author. It was only 70 minutes long. Truly that's better for me, but wasn't what I expected."
5,Put it on your iPod,"I attended a Franklin Covey 7 Habits and changed my life... The next best thing was buying this audiobook and now I carry it on my iPod everywhere I go.Sometimes people complain when they miss a meal, when is the last time you gave your brain something to chew on? 5 stars all the way Steve..."
1,Don't bother...,"I'm giving one star only because there is no ""zero star"" designation. The ""information"" in this book is simple common sense couched in and disguised with flowery language to make it appear more than it is. Almost everyone should already know what's in this book before they read it. I suggest you save your money."
2,A number of years,"I read this book a number of years ago as part of a semester long class with it as the main teaching tool. From what I remember it provides good insights into time management, prioritizing tasks and breaking down a goal into bite size pieces so that a person isn't overwhelmed by the size of what needs to be done."
3,"Not bad, but ""over-intellectualized.""","The book is not bad. It's got some good advice, and if you live your life by the ""Seven Habits,"" then you're going to come out better than if you didn't live by them. But it's my opinion that Covey has made something quite simple quite complex. In other words, I believe that most of the ""Seven Habits"" are nothing profound: treat others like you would like to be treated), be goal-oriented, manage your time wisely, seek the wisdom and insight of others, be slow to speak and quick to listen - nothing new here. The problem is that Covey tends to intellectualize these concepts to the point that many readers may find it difficult to understand what he's talking about at times. And, those that do understand will become frustrated that he takes a whole lot of pages to say something that could have been dealt with in fairly short order."
3,Great material too bad it's one track and much shorter than the book,"Great and intelligent material, and because of that it requires repeatedly listening to it. Now, with one track only you need to FFW in order to go to a deeper section of the book.Also, this is a much shorter version of the book, so you must have the book too if you connect to this materials.Thank you Stephen for your contribution.I love it"
3,"Same Book, New Cover","I gave this one three-stars, because it turned out that this is the SAME book (but with a different cover) that was published a number of years ago. That fact was not clear to me when I read the description. Had I known that I would not have purchased it, as I have the prior book. It is a good book, but the lack of clarity as to WHICH edition it was, was really disappointing. There is NO new material in this book."
5,Excellent!!!,These are the best audio tapes I have ever read!!! They have changed my life indefinitely. I went from a hated poverty-stricken loser to a millionaire well admired and efficient man. I am constantly asked to speak at charity events and others. Buy these audio cassettes and read them. They WILL change your life too!!!!
3,Still reading through this,It is a very interesting book and I'm still working my way through it. I like the fact that its based on Victor Frankl's Mans Search for meaning which is must buy/borrow for anyone who hasn't read it.
5,One of the best books about Success,"This book will make history. Every page seems to have years of experience.A lot of material about effectiveness. Not only to business, but also family. BUY IT!"
3,Book I got...,"Reviewing this product, finally... Well this book wasn't for me, I ordered it for my aunt, I have no idea how good or bad this book was/is. I will, however, rate how it took to get here. For one book, it took a lil longer than I expected and I must say I have gotten clothes offline faster than that. And that's all I have to say."
5,Simply - the business!,Covey's 7 excellent habits is given an accessible treatment in this comprehensive CD package - ideal for those who have less time to read and appreciate the spoken word.
4,Very good book,This is very well written book. And with lot of practical things that can be used in daily life
3,Didn't keep my interest.,"He had some good things to say and some good points, but for the most part he wasn't telling me anything far from what I already knew. I got bored and never finished the book. Check it out from the library."
1,unset,When I received my books they were the mini ones. When I order these books they said nothing in the description about the size of the book.
1,Coveyisms Shoveyisms,"I can see where this book would appeal to people who like very orderly lives and who like to map everything out. I for one think that living my life by following a mission statement and 7 habits sounds like a drag. I don't think our reason for living is to be ""effective."" I'm not sure what it is for and I like it that way. It is good to not always react to things and take control of your life (Habit 1-Be proactive.) Keeping your priorities straight is smart advice also as is trying to be a better listener and understanding what others are really trying to say. There is nothing wrong with self-improvement, so I can see where this book could be handy. Yet, I must wonder, has Covey said anything in this book that hasn't been said before or that isn't blatantly obvious? Good for him that the was able to make millions upon millions requrgitating these ""habits,"" but I for one am glad I got my book at the library and didn't contribute to his wealth."
3,7 habits of highly effective people,....I was dissappointed that this was not an audio novel. It touches on key aspects without diving into deeper meaning.
3,Not that much new information in here,This book was okay but did not contain that much new information for me. I felt I was already doing much of what Covey suggests.
5,Exceptional Book,"Steven Covey struck gold with this book. He manages to help readers find their way to better effectiveness step by step in this groundbreaking book. The book is broken down by success habits. It's an exceptional book and I recommend it highly.Kristie Dean, author of Reformat Your Life (available on Amazon)"
3,A dissapointment,"To be honest, this book was a bit of dissapointment to me. As it is one of the most often recommended books in ""self improvement"" it somehow left me with a feeling of emptiness after reading it.Too high aims of the author and too much obvious outcome and advises to any having at least a bit of common sense, as well as sometimes too much religious approach while secretly trying to create something like a religion of authors own makes it one of the most overestimated books I've read in my life.And, by the way, the taglines of the book communicate the main ideas - the rest of the text is just beating around the bush"
2,7 Habits of Highly Effective People,"If you don't already realize everything that is said in this book, you probably can't read anyway. The book is years old. It spouts common sense, mundane platitudes, making it boring to read and highly ineffecitve.Amazing what some people succed in getting into print."
1,Seven Habits?,"Actually, I was (and I'm sure you will be too) surprised when I found upon reading Covey's self-help classic, that there are embedded within his highly helpful rhetorical flourishes actually EIGHT habits for ""highly effective people"". By applying Marshall Mcluhan's elegant and axiomatic adage ""the medium is the message"" I was able to discover the EIGHTH habit, which is to write self-help books and make a lot of money from them."
2,I gave the stars because it has helped a lot of people.,"I forced my way through this book. Never felt that 'a ha' moment. Even tried the CD's but, again, I was left cold and only temporarily inspired.However, I know folks that have changed their whole productivity patterns as a result of this book - so I know that it does good for some folks. I'm almost jealous of them for having such success!I like Tony Robbins better even though Covey considers him nothing more than a pep talk. Robbins is more my age and much more dynamic of a personality (entertaining). I'm productive in my own way and style; and having fun on this globe still rules over any acedemic or professional accomplishments that could be derived by trading my world for a seat in quadrant 2.But, who knows, I may find the inspiration to try this 7 Habit program one more time, just not yet. Again, that is only because I've SEEN it work for others in a BIG TIME way."
2,How to Turn Yourself Into A Robot,"I don't know why so many people think this book is so special. What I saw in it was just ideas that we all know explained in a way so complicated with confusing drawings and schematics that make the book very annoying. Even without this practice of easy concepts into rocket science, the ideas seem unnatural and contrary to the things that make us human. Maybe it is just what some people want so they can translate each activity into a formula or a matrix."
1,disappointed,"I mistakenly bought this book. I selected the book so quickly I didn't read the fine print, ""miniature"". The amazon price $5.95. Normal retail is $4.95. It is a 2in x 2in size book with 95 pages averaging a little over one sentence per page. You do the math. Buy the real book not this miniature version. Any Covey book is worth the investment...er, uhh maybe just not this one."
3,Hardcover=Miniature - Buy Paperback instead,Being of Yankee-descent I usually buy the cheaper of the two: paperback or hardcover. Mistake this time! The Hardcover is actually a miniature version of the book - paraphrased in a minimal amount of pages - suitable only for perhaps reading it on the sly in church. See dimensions in the fine print. Buy the 300+page paperback instead!
4,"Good but Heavy ""reading""",Covey's material is very good but his writing style has a high academic tone. An easy read it is not.
4,Is that Aretha?,"Great remake -- taking one of the best songs (from the best), spicing it up, and adding in a few extra treats -- for a great song..."
4,Good price and works,"It arrived on time, good price and works.I order other Supco 90380 from Amazon before. Supco sometimes make noise, White Rogers so far so good."
3,cornbread earl and me,"..Very timely even though this movie was from the 1970's, I would tell audiences of the 1970's genre movie to add this one to your collection..mint condition!!!"
4,Mixed Blessings,"Given the era and how so many films are degraded as blaxploitation, this was one that shouldn't carry that burden. The theme of ""us against the man"" was explored in a different way as no one picked up a gun and began blazing through the streets. A young Black Man that could have made it through ball but was killed along with the dream; this was told on film and in real life in different ways that were so similiar: Cochise in Cooley High, Ben Wilson in Chicago. The only diff being the man did it in this one and the Black residents that coulda and shoulda, wouldn't.Always a pleasure to see a young Fishburne work his lines and any 70's baller recognizes Jamaal Wilkes. An excellent movie, just don't be surprised if you feel the pain too."
1,Don't waste your time,Really have nothing good to say about this book. Only sorry that I wasted my time reading it.
5,mahjongg master 4,"The very first time i played this game was at my daughters home. I downloaded the game when i returned home. had the game for four years before i lost the computer. when i bought a new computer, i tried to download the same game from the website bit later found out it was not the same. then i remembered the orginal name of this game and found it on amazon.com. now i have the game itself and can download it any time and where ever i go. i am happy playing the game once again"
4,Nice lego toy,"This is a pretty good Lego toy. It was fairly tedious to put together - especially since there was one step skipped in the directions. After much confusion and more examination we finally figured out what was missing but it was a little annoying and took some time. My 4 yr old son loves it so far, except that the launch pad comes apart easily. It is pretty cool - Legos have come a long way."
1,Piece of Crap,"I live in a town in KY that IS this movie, only difference folks is that it is meth not pot these days! Yes life really does exist like this or worse. So, I do not recommend this movie, it is depressing, degenerative, boring, and presented the people accurately with an average IQ of a cucumber. ""Pitiful"" says it all about the movie and my town. Also, It was advertised incorrectly(ie:no detective story)."
5,Great Videos,"My son loves this video and all of the Lots To Learn Videos. Unlike most vidoes, the Lots to Learn vidoes keep his attention the whole time. Buster and Gatto are so cute and make him laugh, and the songs are very catchy. Best of all, they are educational so I don't feel guilty sitting him in front of the TV because I know he is going to learn. I highly recommend all of these videos."
1,Ugh!,"The package boasts ""classic cartoons""; this must refer to age only and not content or quality. The Warner Bros. cartoons have been stripped of their opening sequences with the credits and the ""Merrie Melodies"" theme music. Some of the other cartoons (Felix the Cat, Gabby, Toonerville Trolly) just aren't in the same league with those wonderful Warner Bros. Looneytoons. The picture restoration is fair; the sound restoration is tinny, and the ""enhancements"" to the sound effects are distracting. Save your money and buy something else."
5,This is the best animated movie I've ever seen,"I first saw Rainbow Brite when I had chicken pox at age five. When I woke up crying at 4 AM because it was so itchy, my mom would put in this video and it would all be ok. This has been my favorite TV show (closely followed by Care Bears) since then, and I love every part of this movie, from the creative plot to the awesome music to the clever characters. The animation, for its time, is wonderful, and as good as, if not better than, the animated cartoons we have today. I watch this movie when I'm sad, and when it ends I'm ready to conquer the world. I've recruited three new Rainbow Brite fans with this movie, and even the people that didn't like the movie had to admit it was good. I strongly recommend this movie for everyone; it won't scare little kids, and it's a MUCH better feel-good movie than a chick flick. If you watch this movie, I guarantee you'll love it."
3,not sexist,"It's missing the point dramatically to say that this film depicts girls as useless. There's a fairly typical boy/girl rivalry depicted, yes, but I don't believe anyone who watched the film from the start could reasonably think that girls are depicted as useless or powerless in it.I was able to figure out that the Krys character's opinion of girls was biased and unjustified (and, ultimately, proven wrong within the film) when I was eight. Today I'm a self-described feminist and I still think ""Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer"" presents a number of positive and powerful role models for young girls. I'd happily recommend it."
5,Brite eyes,"Rainbow Brite (Bettina Bush - ALSO the voice of Megan in My Little Pony ^_-), must save the world from the evil dark Princesse in this fantastic 80s film. The animation is really cute and brite, and is backed up nicely by a great score. I love this film and still remember my mum renting this out for me over and over again along with ""Labyrinth"" as a treat. HEY, that was 11/12 years ago! YET I still love it! Don't let Rainbow Brite die, they might have only made 13 forgotton episodes of the actual show, but buy this movie for your kids and the rainbow will never fade ;)"
4,Rainbow Brite question,was there 2 Rainbow Brite movies?? Whens the other one coming out if theres two??? Thanks.and my review is I love Rainbow Brite!!
3,It'll do,"But I preferred the box that came with VideoSecu. But, the cable is the part that is important, so it'll do."
5,Leaves surpasses expectations with its rich descriptions.,"110 specimens are the result of Alice Vitale's life-long avocation and work. The leaf drawings are exquisite and each herb is delightfully presented with a smattering of folklore, origins, medicinal uses, quotes and poems. Some very obscure herbs are covered in this compendium."
5,Later editions aren't the same,"What makes the first edition the best book of its kind is that it organizes plants by how they are used in landscaping (e.g., hedges and shrubs), then by color. So you determine what you want to do with the plants and how you want them to look, and it lists all of your choices with great color photos as well as height and width info.You'll have to buy a used copy to get the original organization model. Later editions list plants alphabetically, which is pretty much useless."
3,A Topical Richard Brooks Drama,"I have yet to see this film played on any Television cable channel. Brooks brings to the screen Robert Ruark's novel about the Mau Mau uprisings in the then British East Africa.Its a powerful story that is well acted by Rock Hudson, Sidney Poitier, Dana Wynter and Wendy Hiller.Here is a chance to see a terrific actor named Juano Hernandez( Young Man With a Horn, "" The Pawnbroker"") deliver the goods.Time has changed attitudes on subjects like these situations portrayed here. However, parts of this drama are salient even today although framed differently. One can take the geography out of this part of Africa and transpose these types of conflicts to other continents. Directed with care by Mr. Brooks."
1,Horrible!!! Printers can't line up with sticker!!! Tried 4 different printers!!!,DO NOT BUY!!!! I tried to print the images on the stickers with 4 different ink jet printers and it doesn't line up. I wasted 10 dollars on two packs of these and wasted them all!!! Buy a case or pre-made sticker.
2,Only for INKJET printers,"Just FYI: this tattoo paper only works in inkjet printers. Something I didn't realize until after order arrived! Grrr.. Two stars for cool idea, but not laser printer friendly."
1,Worthless,"This watch was terrible. It had all the features I wanted and none of the reliability. The watch periodically turns off, resetting the time and all the alarms. Comes back on when all four buttons are pressed, so the battery can't need replacing. If that weren't bad enough, the glue holding the band together came undone."
4,Quiet hours over the board,"A nice study on how to improve one's chess game. It seems one of the best ways to get better at chess is to learn how to learn to play chess -- its pedagogy. Although the chapters in this book are not progressive, the variety of chapters allows the learner to pick and choose the study. My ELO is only 1900, so I would not recommend this book to beginners."
2,Not what I expected,"Many professional chess book reviewers claim this is for the advanced player (FIDE rating of 2000+). ([...]) It ""goes without saying"" that anything by Dvoretsky is for the serious player who wants to put in the time and has an extensive chess background.Most of the articles are very good, however the exercises are way to easy to be useful (if you read the articles). My disappointment was mainly that this book is a collection of seemingly random and unconnected articles/lectures, few of them had anything to do with actual ""chess training."" The ones that did were very creative and different than what most Western players are familiar/comfortable with...I suppose if you are at that the level where one idea will make that much of a difference you might get something out of this book... however, if you need a system of thought or some teaching on a process then look elsewhere."
4,Good Gaming Book,If your into gaming this is a book for you. It delivers what it promises in providing the key essential to gaming. I recommend it.
5,Game Development praise,"Jeannie Novak's book Game Development Essentials is an excellent text covering the scope of today's gaming environment. Everything from story development, marketing, character development and audience demographics is covered in this text. She uses highly appropriate first person narratives from industry professionals and has excellent study guide questions at the conclusion of each chapter. The CD included also has great game demos and trials as well as excellent links to web sites that add enrichment to the reading. I look forward to her other upcoming titles."
5,Great Service,"It is the book i needed for school, well actually one edition older than i needed but it had all the same info. The seller was extremely quick in shipping the product and it arrived promptly ."
2,Bad use of airborne troops,Very much the most excellent good guys against the very bad bad guys. Both use troops up badly.
1,"Oh, Brother!","The great Lupe Velez deserves a good biography, but this ain't it. To paraphrase the late Mrs. Parker, ""this is not a book to be tossed aside lightly. It is to be thrown with great force."""
5,MiRiCAL22003,"I was told that I had PCOS because my cycle was simply ""irregular"" & I was on a car accident that almost took my life & my cycles changed even more, didn't have a menstrual cycle for years! I got this book which names ALL my symptoms which then made me go get PROPER testing & was officially diagnosis ed with PCOS! THiS BOOK WAS GREAT & FULL OF HELPFUL INFORMATION!"
4,PCOS - ????,I had never heard of PCOS before my OB/GYN gave me my diagnosis that I had this syndrome. I was very anxious to find out all that I could and still go back to this book when I have questions. More women should ask their doctor about this syndrome especially if you are watching your diet and exercising but not losing weight.
3,The evolution of a filmaker.,"Sorry I cheated. I was watching Dick Cavett interviewing Woody Allen in 1971 0n TCM, & got sucked in again watching Bananas. Hadn't seen it in years. Not his best or nearly so, but it was only his 2nd & he was still perfecting his craft. Fielding Mellish is dating Nancy, a political activist. She dumps him presumably for his insincerity. To get her back (& in the sack) he becomes a freedon fighter in a small tropical dictatorship. Funny, absurd & ultmately uneven. If it is your bag, this needs to be in your Allen archives as the beginning of a brillant screenwriter/director. The bits with Howard Cosell are stiil laugh out loud funny after multiple viewings."
1,"Slipped, lacks appeal","This is a good movie for people who don't like to think too much. While better than watching (un)reality TV or monster truck rallies, as far as I'm concerned this isn't a film for fans of Woody Allen, it's just a series of really thin gags which make me want to. Woody's ""Sleeper"" is a more sophisticated version of ""Bananas"" (and it was better shot) and of the two, get the former. This is one of those ""earlier, funny ones"" referenced in the usually underrated ""Stardust Memories"". Like ""Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Sex"", it isn't a high point of his career."
5,I can't believe I found this:),"I saw this movie twice back in 82, and still remember most of the words to the songs. ""Leaping, leaping leaping for lunch,dressed like a salad,how does it feel?"". Wasn't her blowup pool sand box bed the best! I can't believe I found a way to get a copy of it. It's a MUST Have movie for 80's culture and musical buffs."
1,Failed attempt at comedy,"Made in America fails to bring in the laughs, and worse, it presents a great opportunity to deal with race issues, yet never deals with it beyond ""He's white? He can't be your father!""This film begins with a promising premise. What if a black girl found out her father, a sperm donor, was actually white? But instead of creating a fascinating mix of social commentary on race and brilliant comedy, it gives us slapstick. And unfunny slapstick at that. I laughed... once.This film's one saving grace is Whoopie. She adds some energy to most of her scenes. But even she seems unexcited to be in this movie. It's one of her least funny roles. Made in America also gives a young Will Smith a role, and it's clear from the start that it wasn't until after this film that he matured as an actor.This movie is only for really, really big Whoopie fans."
4,History is only as boring as your teacher,"The book is not boring on any account. It is not an easy subject, but the author does explain the different forces behind the failure of 1917 and the success of 1918. The book is not a typical historical resource. Johnson uses forshadowing and vivid description to give it a novel quality. If you want to know more about the politics behind the stalemate and the final victory in World War I, then I would highly recommend this book."
5,Track listing,"01: put a little love in your heart 3:5002: ""family love"" mix sample :3003: ""pure melissa"" women's mix sample :3004: ""just a little"" men's mix sample :30"
4,Helpful and reliable,"What can you say about a hornbook? I'm trying to review the ones I use for class as fast as I finish using them, but except for famous ones like Prosser and Keeton, there's not much to do other than point out whether I found them helpful and reliable.This one was both. As an evening law student with delusions of eternal youth, I just completed two semesters of property law during summer session, and I surely found Hovenkamp's discussions useful. (In general I prefer hornbooks to casebooks anyway.) The text includes lots of sample problems as well; you may especially appreciate this feature when you discuss estates, future interests, and the Rule Against Perpetuities.I didn't notice anything that clearly set it apart from other property-law hornbooks, but we don't, after all, buy these things for the bells and whistles. It's a solid book that covers a standard subject in pretty much the standard order. Recommended to law students."
5,duet of the decade,"This duet CD embodies the most simpatico expression of two jazz musicians in the last decade, bringing to mind the duets of Duke Elllington and John Coltrane, and Bill Evans and Jim Hall. From the Michael Wolff original Polly, to Alex Fosters's own Pool of Dreams, to the Mingus and Monk tunes, these two masters, Wolff of the piano and Foster of the saxophone, create a soulful, impressionist flight of fancy that transforms notes and rhythms into the magic of textures and colors. This CD is a must for any CD collection, and for anyone who only wants to own one CD, this is the one."
2,Can't listen 'N learn while driving ...,"I bought these CDs hoping to listen and learn while driving. Unfortunately, the CDs require that you listen, read the book, and follow along, so it's not possible to just listen and learn; you need to refer to the book while listening. The sound level of the dialogues is much lower than the voice of the person leading the lessons, so you have to adjust the volume every time he talks. This is distracting and annoying. A disppointment, on the whole."
5,love this story,"this book is great for therapists who work with young children! my daughter also brought this to preschool when she was 3 yo and her entire class enjoyed it. good for improving labeling, sequencing, identifying, and cause and effect skills. the ending is especially fun."
2,disappointing quality,"I happen to really like this film. It's one that I can watch repeatedly and always enjoy. But the DVD version has such poor video quality that I returned it and have kept the VHS. The sceen in the graveyard, in particular, is not what I'd expect if a decent master has been used for the transfer. Check it out, but keep your receipt!"
4,The Great Train Robbery,"Connery and Sutherland provided an exciting re-enactment of the famous robbery. Although the ending was different, the entire movie was filled with suspense ans excitement. Well worth watching."
2,"Great movie, miserable quality","This is an excellent movie - well acted, good plot and character development... but truly miserable video quality. It appears to have been ""mastered"" from the VHS issue... and not very well at that. Truly a shame."
2,great movie but DVD has truly dismal video quality,"Everything about this DVD movie of Michael Crichton's The Great Train Robbery is marvelous except for the truly abysmal, grainy low resolution quality of the video itself. I don't know what the source of the problem is, but the result is one of the worst DVD's I've ever viewed when it comes to the actual video quality of the product. Virtually every scene is grainy and out of focus. It's a shame such great sets, great acting, great costumes, and great plot are all marred by the genuinely bad video quality. In sum, if you value video quality, do not buy this DVD. And, just to be clear, I'm not judging this DVD against a blu-ray. I have seen VHS tapes with as good and even better video quality than this DVD has. Someone should make a new transfer/copy/version of this, or even better, make a good quality blu-ray. I wish I had read the reviews more carefully as I probably would not have purchased this had I known how bad the video really is."
1,Elixir crapweb.,"If anyone is thinking about buying these, DON'T. Do not waste your money on these strings. If you like to precisely control what you're playing (especially if you play Metal), do not get these strings. The coating is too slippery and feel uncomfortable. And most importantly!! The tone is NOT bright and the sustain is horrible. They can't hold a chord without fading quickly especially if you bend a lot. If you want amazing, well manufactured, loud and controllable strings I suggest checking out GHS Boomers. With GHS you will not be disappointed, unlike Elixir. ( I personally use GHS Boomers TnT [thin top heavy bottom])"
4,Good as usual,"Strings work like good strings should. I've been a fan of these for years, both when I played classical and then when I switched to acoustic steel string guitars. They usually take a little longer to break in but they keep a brighter tone for much longer than Ernie Balls, Markeleys, and other strings I've used."
4,Charming little film,"For those unfamiliar with GÃ©rard Depardieu, GREEN CARD is a charming introduction. Good performances from both Depardieu and Andie MacDowell, and Bebe Neuwirth is delightful in a supporting role. When things get ""unfair"", the reminders that the central marriage of convenience is illegal are refreshing.The DVD is presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen with both English and French Dolby 5.1 audio tracks. No extras, but even so an excellent bargain."
4,One of my all-time favorites!,"Classic boy-meets-girl romantic comedy, but the story woven around this bare outline is new and different and totally delightful. The non-standard happy/sad ending only adds to its charm.Except for a couple of instances where a seriously ""four-letter"" word is used (to the embarrassment of the characters in the story), this is a movie that the whole family would be comfortable viewing together.I'm glad I own the tape!"
3,Prancer,"I liked the little girls determination and final result. I really enjoy Sam Elliott's work, but I didn't like Sam Elliott playing a mean spirited father."
5,Prancer - A must for your Christmas Movie Collection,"At our house - we are Christmas movie fans, and this one is right near the top of our list with White Christmas, Its a Wonderful Life, and One Magic Christmas. Delightful, enjoyable and a heartwarming story of a girl who will NOT let go of her zeal for Christmas and all things attached to it.Great for all ages.And Sam Elliott still looks good even when scruffy in this movie."
1,I never actually revceived my order,"I placed my order for this DVD on December 13th ... I was told that it would ship on the 15th but may not arrive until January 5th. Needless to say, this gift did not arrive in time for the holidays. It is now January 19th and I have seen no sign of my order. I have contacted the seller twice through email and never heard back. On the bright side, at least my order was only $9! I do not plan to ever order from this seller again."
4,Fun Christmas movie.,"This is a good Christmas movie...not on par with It's a Wonderful Life, Miracle on 34th Street, or The Christmas Story (which I actually didn't care for, but I know lots of people love it), but it's a good story. I like having Christmas movies on DVD, so I can pop one in when I'm doing my Christmas baking."
5,Excellent,I love this book. The pictures are excellent and the recipes are simple and easy to follow.The book arrived by the promised delivery date and in excellent condition.Thank you
5,The music I have been finding for 2 years,I am korean. I heard Cafe Reggio when I was in New York for my studying. Sometimes I heard it from WQ CD 101.9 that is smoohtjazz station in New York. But at that time I did not know the musitian and title. It took about a week to find out this music and musitian. I happened to find smoothjazz guitar album and wrote down names of the players. I searched all of them name by name in this amazon address. Finally I fount this. This passion shows the degree I like this music. Easy melody and very wonderful sound
4,My Niece Loves It!,"This was a gift for my niece, Erika. She loves it, and from what I know it works great. I gave it four out of five stars, because, in my mind, it has a cheap look to it and looks like it could fall apart without too much effort. That said, Erika made a padded case for its protection and thinks it's fab. It seems to work well, tunes well, and is loud enough as a metronome to hear over her violin. So - I definitely recommend this, but just use it carefully."
2,Streisand's nose and voice go on forever...,"Far too much singing and profile shots of the schnozz from hell. I much preferred the South Park episode of MECHA-STREISAND that accurately portrays the actress as a 50-foot tall robot that eats people, shoots missiles from her nose, and yearns to take over the world. The scenery and costumes are good in Yentl, and the plot is fairly engaging (though it follows the usual cliches of cross-dressing ala Shakespeare, Bosom Buddies, Tootsie, etc.). If you took out the singing, the movie would be much better... and about 20 minutes long. It's worth seeing, I guess, as long as your remote mute button works. I'm buying a copy for a friend as a joke."
3,Mono!,"Not to rain on your parade, but the reason it is finally being released and for such a bargain price, is because the film is unaltered from its original form and the soundtrack is therefore in mono. Yentl was released on DVD in Europe (region code 2) two years ago, with the same disappointing mono soundtrack and no extra's. Why Miss Streisand hasn't bothered to finalize her pet project and make sure it was released with a new digitalized 5.1 surround soundtrack is beyond me. We all know the film and score deserve it. Nevertheless it will finally be available in the States for home entertainment! Enjoy!"
5,Facsinating and believable.,I enjoyed Yentl very much. It is an eye opener onto the private lives of strict judiasm. It should be required by all to watch.
4,"Lovely Cinematography, Beautiful Music, Great Story!",I really think that this is such a great movie and I can't believe that I am just now watching it. It will not be the last time for me.....I hope to watch it many more times.
5,"A joy to read. Intelligent, fast paced. A must read!!!",I thouroughly enjoyed this book. It's a thrill ride like few I've read A real page turner. Morrell's style shines in this one. I recommend it to anyone who loves thrill rides (and has a strong stomach) It makes you think and put things together. It also shocks you over and over again.
